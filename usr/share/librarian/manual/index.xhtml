<h1>Rarian Reference Manual v0.6</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This manual describes version 0.6 of Rarian, a documentation meta-data
library.  It is split into three sections, which are relevant for
different people.  The first section covers writing Rarian meta-data
files and is useful for people wishing their documentation to be
visible in applications using Rarian.</p>

<p>The second section describes the Rarian library.  This details the
available API and requirements for using it.  This section is aimed at
developers wishing to use the power of Rarian in their applications.</p>

<p>The final section describes the scrollkeeper compatibility stuff in
Rarian and how to take advantage of this.  It isn't really useful for
anyone, but is included for completeness.</p>
