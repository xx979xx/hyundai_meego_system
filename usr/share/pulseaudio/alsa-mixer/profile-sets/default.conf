; Default profile definitions for the ALSA backend of PulseAudio. This
; is used as fallback for all cards that have no special mapping
; assigned. (and should be good enough for the vast majority of
; cards).  Use the udev property PULSE_PROFILE_SET to assign a
; different profile set than this one to a device.  So what is this
; about? Simply, what we do here is map ALSA devices to how they are
; exposed in PA. We say which ALSA device string to use to open a
; device, which channel mapping to use then, and which mixer path to
; use. This is encoded in a 'mapping'. Multiple of these mappings can
; be bound together in a 'profile' which is then directly exposed in
; the UI as a card profile. Each mapping assigned to a profile will
; result in one sink/source to be created if the profile is selected
; for the card.
