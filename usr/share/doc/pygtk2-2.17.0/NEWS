pygtk-1.99.17:  31-July-2003
	- Threading support is compiled in by default now.  It is
	  necessary to call gtk.threads_init() in order to make use of
	  threading though.  There have been a number of fixes to the

	  code, rather than the two stage wrapper like the 1.2 branch.


---- GTK-1.2 branch ----

pygtk-0.6.11:  23-August-2002
	- Fix up libtool patch for older binutils'.
	- a few bug fixes in some GtkWidget methods.

pygtk-0.6.10:  22-August-2002
	- Fix up segfaults when using with a Python compiled with
	  pymalloc.
	- various new wrapper functions added.
	- Raise exception if gtk_init() fails.
	- bug fixes.
	- Support parallel install with PyGTK 2.0.

pygtk-0.6.9:  3-Janyary-2002
	- always check the return value of functions for NULL values.
	  This fixes a number of problems which caused crashes on
	  exit.
	- add pygt_version and gtk_version variables.
	- update to autoconf-2.52/automake-1.5
	- many bug fixes (see ChangeLog).

pygtk-0.6.8:  23-April-2001
	- bug fixes to GtkNotebook, GtkCList.
	- add some missing methods to GtkWidget
	- a gdk-pixbuf wrapper module.
	- install the code generator, so that other wrappers can use
	  it as well.

pygtk-0.6.7:  16-February-2001
	- added --disable-thread configure argument to turn off thread
	  support even when compiling with a threaded python.
	- resets LC_NUMERIC back to "C" after calling gtk_set_locale,
	  as this is the standard setting for python, no matter what
	  the locale.
	- various other bug fixes.

pygtk-0.6.6:  7-April-2000
	- switched over to using the CVS version of automake rather than
	  my `pyautomake' patches, as CVS automake now has the python
	  support integrated.  Libtool is now used to build the extensions,
	  so if there are problems on your platform, it is a libtool
	  problem :)
	- typo fixes.
	- new pointer_(un)grab and keyboard_(un)grab methods for GdkWindow.

pygtk-0.6.5:  13-March-2000
	- more reference leaks fixed.
	- crashes when changing window properties with 16 or 32 bit data
	  formats fixed.
	- some libglade wrapper fixes.
	- various other fixes.

pygtk-0.6.4:  16-February-2000
	- gnome-python now requires python >= 1.5.2, as it uses the 'N'
	  format tag for PyArg_ParseTuple.
	- Reference leak fixes.
	- A few new features.

pygtk-0.6.3:  30-September-1999
	- if the new gnome-python is installed, the libglade module will load
	  the gnome support.  Make sure you remember to import gnome.ui if the
	  glade file contains any gnome widgets.
	- New methods for GdkWindow objects -- lower, _raise (for stacking
	  order manipulation) and input_get_pointer (for XInput stuff).
	- A few other bugs have been fixed as well.  See ChangeLog for details.

pygtk-0.6.2:  9-August-1999
	- Threading should work correctly with multiple threads accessing
	  GTK (assuming they use threads_enter/leave).  Thanks go to Matt
	  Wilson and Paul Fisher for this code.
	- A pygtk.h header file is now installed that should make it easier
	  to write extensions to pygtk.
	- There is now optional support for the gtkglarea widget and the
	  libglade library now.
	- There is support for gdkrgb functions for rendering rgb and greyscale
	  image data to a drawable.
	- Optional support for numpy arrays.  You can create a GdkImlibImage
	  from a numpy array, and manipulate an image's data as an array.
	  Also there is a gdk_draw_array wrapper that uses gdkrgb to render
	  an array to a drawable.  The code for the imlib stuff is based on
	  stuff submitted by Travis Oliphant.
	- The GdkWindow type now has some methods for manipulating properties,
	  and has an xid attribute for getting the X window ID of the window.
	- idle_add and timeout_add can now pass extra parameters to the
	  callback, like you can do for signals.  Also added a wrapper
	  for signal handlers similar to gtk_signal_connect_object.

pygtk-0.6.1:  22-May-1999
	- Fixed a few bugs to do with the threading patches I applied in the
	  last release.  Threading should now work correctly.

pygtk-0.6.0:  25-April-1999
	- updated for gtk+-1.2.1.
	- You can now write multithreaded programs in python (if python was
	  compiled with thread support enabled, of course).  This feature
	  is thanks to Duncan Grisby <dgrisby@uk.research.att.com>.
	  To use the multithreading, write your program as normal, but
	  before calling any GTK routines from outside the GTK thread (ie.
	  not from a signal handler or timeout/idle func), call threads_enter()
	  before hand, and threads_leave() after.
	- Various bug fixes.

pygtk-0.5.11:  24-February-1999
	- Updated for gtk+-1.1.16
	- Changes to the style code, so that you can now write to the
	  attributes.  There is also a copy() method, which can be used
	  so you don't change the style on other objects.
	- Some changes so some functions which are supposed to accept NULL
	  arguments will accept None in place of a boxed/string/object
	  argument.
	- Added a file MAPPING that describes the mapping of GTK onto python.
	- Various bug fixes.
	- Pyglade XML parser made more robust.

pygtk-0.5.10:  9-February-1999
	- Updated for gtk+-1.1.14/15.
	- Fixed up some selection problems.
	- Added DnD example translated by Chi-Deok Hwang.
	- Some ctree fixes.
	- Some function renamings.
	- more functionality in the pixmap creation routines (you can create
	  a pixmap if you have a GdkColormap but no GdkWindow).
	- added GdkWindow.depth attribute.

pygtk-0.5.9:
	- Updated for gtk+-1.1.9

pygtk-0.5.8:  10-December-1998
	- I made a mistake during building the last package.  I ran
	  cvs co pygtk; aclocal; automake --add-missing; autoconf; configure
	  followed by make dist.  Unfortunately, since there was no configure
	  file when I ran automake, it didn't get added to the dist list.
	- Updated the spec files to match new version.

pygtk-0.5.7:  9-December-1998
	- Updated for gtk+-1.1.6.  Probably not much will change between now
	  and 1.2.
	- Added GtkCTree, GtkLayout, GtkPlug and GtkSocket widgets.
	- There has been a renaming of a number of commonly used functions.
	  if you use gtk.py, the old names still work, but give a warning.
	  To get a list of the name changes, see the file
	  $(prefix)/include/gtk/gtkcompat.h
	- signal connection now uses the gtk_signal_connect_full function,
	  rather than relying on the default marshaller.
        - The append, prepend and insert methods of the toolbar now return
          the widget that was added, like the C equivalents do.

pygtk-0.5.6:  27-November-1998
	- Updated for gtk+-1.1.5.
	- Renamed Gtkinter.py to gtk.py.  This follows the naming scheme of
	  other modules more closely, and is easier for people who prefer to
	  use "import ...".  It is also not a big change for people who
	  use "from ... import *".  I have included a simple Gtkinter.py
	  module for backward compatibility.
	- Added a private function PyGtk_RegisterBoxed that can be used to add
	  extra boxed types to the list of those registered in the callback
	  marshals and the like.

pygtk-0.5.5:  17-November-1998
        - Fixed a small bug in GdkImlib that caused a syntax error (I should
          have picked this up for the last release).
        - Removed some function wrappers that are not used anywhere, in order
          to get pygtk to compile cleanly on newer CVS GTK's.
        - I forgot to include the wrappings for the new GtkCalendar widget in
          the previous release.  It is in this one.

pygtk-0.5.4:  15-November-1998
        - updated for gtk+-1.1.3 (so you will need glib-1.1.4 as well).  This
          release adds support for the new DnD functions, support for
          selection (through the gtk_selection_* functions, which I have
          mapped to GtkWidget.selection_*) and GdkAtoms, and support for
          GdkCursors.
        - To create a new cursor, use the cursor_new or cursor_new_from_pixmap
          function, and then call the GdkWindow.set_cursor method to attach
          it to a window.
        - Added create_pixmap_from_xpm_d function that allows you to embed
          XPM data into your program for easier distribution.
        - Updated the GdkImlib module to the features found in imlib-1.8.
        - Changed the build system, so SWIG is no longer needed.  Also now
          using a modified version of automake to generate the makefiles.
        - Updated the pyglade code to handle menus and the like.

pygtk-0.5.3:  27-September-1998
        - Updated for GTK+-1.1.2 (note that this version of gtk requires
          glib-1.1.3).  This version adds the support for the tearoff menus
          and keyboard navigation of menus (if you use item factory).
        - This is the version of pygtk you will need for the pygnome wrapper
          for gnome v0.30 (when I finish writing them).
	- added events_pending function.  Now you can use code like:
             while events_pending():
                 mainiteration()
          to be sure that a scrollbar has been updated.
        - I have updated the examples/neil/*.py examples to use the
          GtkItemFactory class.  This shows how to make keyboard navigable
          menus.
        - Fixed a typo in GtkWindow.set_focus
        - Fixed signal handler wrapper, so that handlers that return GtkObject
          classes get the return type converted back to the lower level
          GtkObjects.  Also fixed _gtkbasemodule.c, so that return values from
          signals get returned to GTK properly.  These fixes should allow
          people to use the GnomeMDI wrappers in pygnome if you change
          there signal definitions to use GTK_TYPE_OBJECT rather than
          GTK_TYPE_POINTER (I will ask the author to make this change).

pygtk-0.5.2:  31-August-1998
        - fixed the ancestory for the GtkScrolledWindow class, fixed the
          GtkPreview constructor.  Fixed some more spots in _gtkmodule.i
          where I'd used int types instead of the correct enumeration.
        - added the pyglade package.  This will allow you to put a bit of
          code behind interfaces built with GLADE, which can be found at
          http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~damon/builder/index.html
          In my current code, I have implemented most widgets on the
          palette, although the .glade file reader is a bit fragile.  Note
          that this package is not a code generator (yet).  It reads the
          interface description and builds the interface at runtime.  This
          way you can keep the interface separate from the implementation.
          For an example of use, check the examples/glade directory.
        - Added support for the GtkItemFactory.  Still no support for the
          GtkCTree -- even if I did put in support for it, the signal
          definitions define the GtkCTreeNode's as pointers, making it
          almost useless.

pygtk-0.5.1:  19-August-1998
        - fix a small bug in configure script that prevented building.

pygtk-0.5.0:  18-August-1998
        - Updated for GTK+-1.1.1
        - Replaced GtkAcceleratorTable with GtkAccelGroup.
        - Made use of the GtkFlagInfo and GtkEnumInfo structures.  You can now
          specify enum values by a string as well as by a number.  Flag values
          can be given as strings, or as a tuple of strings or numbers that
          are ORed together.
        - Added GtkAccelLabel, GtkFontSelection, GtkFontSelectionDialog,
          GtkPacker and GtkProgress widgets.  Also updated the methods on all
          the other objects.  I haven't yet done GtkCTree or GtkItemFactory.
        - Fixed the gtk_widget_size_request wrapper - it now returns the size
          requisition as a (w,h) tuple.
        - I have split gtkmodule into _gtkbasemodule and _gtkmodule.  The code
          in _gtkbase is no longer generated.  I have gone through and removed
          uneeded code put in by swig.  This reduced the size of that piece
          of source by 25%.  Hopefuly this will speed up some of the core
          functions a bit.  If you use Gtkinter, this change is invisible.
          If you use gtkmodule directly, change:
             from gtk import *
          to
             from _gtkbase import *
             from _gtk import *
             pygtk_init()
          The pygtk_init function is part of the _gtk module, and is called
          to tell it about all the types in _gtkbase.  (it should be called
          by the module's init routine, but I can't find out how to make that
          happen.
        - Updated the Gtkinter.new command.  Now widget arguments don't get
          the widget name prepended, so I have changed the function from
          accepting the arguments as a dictionary to accepting them as
          keyword arguments.  (eg you can do new(GtkWindow, title="title",
          allow_shrink=FALSE)).  On a side note, the GTK_IS_*() functions
          have been removed from gtkmodule and added in gtk_*_get_type()
          functions.  You can get the functionality of the removed functions
          with something like GTK_CHECK_TYPE(obj, gtk_*_get_type()).

pygtk-0.4.5:  5-August-1998
        - This may be the last gtk v1.0 release of pygtk.  If you have anymore
          nagging bugs, tell me now, or they won't be fixed in a version that
          can compile for gtk v1.0 (I will be moving to gtk v1.1)
        - Fixed some small bugs which I got bug reports about, but forgot to
          patch (in draw_polygon, GtkDrawingArea.draw_polygon and load_fontset)
          Also added the font argument to draw_string,draw_text.  This was
          what was causing those problems.
        - Now gtk_set_locale is called when Gtkinter is loaded.  This will
          make pygtk more useful for languages with non-latin character sets
          (eg Japanese).
        - Fixed up new_gc, so that if you don't pass it any arguments, it
          doesn't cause your program to segfault.
        - Made GtkObject.connect and GtkObject.connect_after var arg functions.
          Any extra arguments passed will be added to the argument list for
          the signal handler.
        - Added some attributes to the GdkFont object.  You can now access
          the ascent and descent attributes, and call the width and measure
          methods, which both take a string as an argument.

pygtk-0.4.4:  17-June-1998
        - Updated for gtk+-1.0.4, although it will work with gtk+-1.0.2 (No
          new features were added between these releases).
        - Fixed the date on the last changelog entry :(
        - Added the file description.py.  It contains a breif description
          of some of the objects used in Gtkinter, such as GtkStyle's,
          GdkColors, GdkGC's and so on.  It is structured as a python module,
          but is not intended to be imported.  It can be used as a small
          reference.
        - Added variable GtkCList.selection, and method
          GtkCList.get_selection_info.  These should help using clists, and
          help trap double clicks in a clist, since you can now do something
          like this:
            row, col = clist.get_selection_info(event.x, event.y)
          in a signal handler (maybe button_press).
        - Changed the GdkWindow destroy function to call gdk_pixmap_unref, if
          the window was a pixmap.  This gets rid of the annoying warning
          when you close scribble.py.
        - pointer types and unknown boxed types are now passed as Python
          C objects in signal handlers.  This is so wrappers for add on
          widgets that use pointer arguments can write code to convert
          the pointers to a more usable format.
        - Changed the behaviour of the PyObject -> GtkArg routines so that
          that they use python's conversion routines.  Now you can pass a
          class instance which has a __int__ method in place of an integer
          in those routines (it implicitly uses int(o) on the instance).
        - Added method GtkObject.emit, which acts like gtk_signal_emit.  Now
          widget.show() and widget.emit('show') are equivalent (although the
          first is faster). Now you should be able to use rulers properly.
          The specification is GtkObject.emit(signal_name, arg1, ...).  It
          returns whatever the signal handler was supposed to.  The rulers
          example in the testgtk.py program has been fixed, and gives an
          example of the GtkObject.emit method.
        - Added test of statusbar in testgtk.py.  (The code was submited by
          Andrew Kuchling <akuchlin@cnri.reston.va.us>)
        - Fixed hude memory leak in GdkEvent initialisation -- when adding
          items to a dictionary with PyDict_SetItemString, the third argument
          is INCREF'd.  I was forgetting to DECREF it after finishing with
          it.
        - Added method GdkWindow.new_gc.  It takes keyword arguments with
          names matching the fields of the structure GdkGCValues, defined
          in gdk/gdktypes.h.  It creates a gc for that window with the
          given attributes.  Also, the GdkGC type now has the same attributes
          as the GdkGCValues structure, and they can be read and set.
        - Added a wrapper for the GdkColormap type.  It can be accessed as a
          sequence (eg len(cmap), a = cmap[42], print cmap[:10]).  The
          sequence items are colours.  Also, the GtkStyle and GdkWindow types
          now also have the attribute colormap, which can be used for accessing
          the colormap.  Also, the GdkColor type now has the attributes red,
          green, blue and pixel.
          The colormap also has a single method -- GdkColormap.alloc.  It can
          either be called with a string argument (a colour name), or three
          integers (RGB components).  It does the same thing as the function
          color_alloc (in fact, color_alloc is now implemented using it).

pygtk-0.4.3:  7-May-1998
        - Updated for gtk+-1.0.1.  This version of pygtk will not work with
          earlier versions.  (You should upgrade anyway, since this version
          plugs some security holes and memory leaks).
        - Updated the GdkImlib module to take advntage of new features found
          in Imlib 1.3.  You can now save images into just about any format.
        - Added the types GdkWindow and GdkGC.  Also changed some of the
          functions like gtk_widget_shape_combine_mask to take their correct
          arguments.  This will not break any code written with Gtkinter,
          as I have put in backward compatibility.  However, if you used any
          of these functions in code that directly accessed the gtk module,
          you may have to recode some of your work.
          I have updated some of the testgtk.py examples.  You will notice
          that the toolbar example loads quicker, since the test.xpm is only
          read off disk once.
        - Added the gdk_draw_* functions, and wrote wrappers for them as
          methods of the GtkDrawingArea class.  See examples/simple/scribble.py
          for an example of using pixmaps and the drawing area.

pygtk-0.4.2:  22-April-1998
        - Updated for gtk+-1.0.0.  Since there have been no API changes
          between 0.99.10 and 1.0.0, it should work with that version as well.
        - Updated the configure script.  It now uses the gtk-config script to
          work out the cflags and libraries for GTK.  If gtk-config is not on
          the path, you can pass configure an argument something like
          --with-gtk-config=/subdir/gtk-config.
        - You can now specify the path name for the python executable (if it
          isn't on the path) with the --with-python=/subdir/python argument.
        - There is now a 'make install' option.  It should work with both
          python 1.4 and 1.5.x.  It defaults to installing scripts the
          $(prefix)/lib/site-python, with $(prefix)/lib/python$(version) as
          a backup, and shared modules in $(prefix)/lib/python$(version)
          /site-packages with $(prefix)/lib/python$(version)/lib-dynload and
          $(prefix)/lib/python$(version)/sharedmodules as backup locations.
          It also checks that the directory is in python's search path before
          making the choice.
          If you have installed previous versions of pygtk, it is probably a
          good idea to remove those files before running 'make install', as
          the locations chosen by this routine may be different from where
          you installed previous versions.
        - Changed the gtk_init function slightly, so it doesn't immediately
          call the gtk_*get_type functions, instead deferring this till the
          first call to gtk_object_new.  This shouldn't affect anyone's
          programs, other than making loading slightly quicker.
        - Also added support for return types for signals (this only breaks
          compatibility if your handlers didn't return None or 0 or whatever).
          You should now be able to do things like returning TRUE from a
          delete_event signal handler to prevent a window being destroyed.
	- Added some functions for GtkCurve's and GtkPreview's that were
          previously missing.
        - Fixed some of the typemap stuff.  GtkAspectFrame, GtkToolQuery and
          GtkCList.get_row_data now work properly.  Also fixed a few similar
          problems in GdkImlib.

pygtk-0.4.1:  6-April-1998
        - This archive is slightly smaller than the previous version, because
          I accidently included some unneeded files.  (The package isn't
          missing anything that is required).
        - Updated for gtk+-0.99.9.  Note that the previous version of pygtk
          works fine with 0.99.9, so this release is mainly new features.
        - There is now a mailing list for pygtk.  To subscribe, send mail to
          pygtk-request@daa.com.au, with the word subscribe in the body.
          There is also a web site at http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/,
          although it isn't very interesting yet.
        - updated the examples/ide/gtkcons.py to take advantage of word
          wrapping in the text widget.
        - Added a function to export the Python types used in Gtkinter, so
          other python bindings (such as the imlib one) can use them.
          (It should be possible to do gnome bindings -- I will look at that
          in a little while).
	- Added support for gdk_imlib.  Note that this does not change
          what libraries are required to build Gtkinter.  If you don't
          have gdk_imlib, the configure script will notice, and decide not
          to build support for it.  If you have gdk_imlib, and don't want to
          build it, you can pass configure the argument --without-imlib.
        - Added the directory examples/imlib, and a simple multi format
          image viewer called examples/imlib/view.py.  This example requires
          the imlib bindings to have been built.

pygtk-0.4.0:  23-Mar-1998
        - Updated for gtk+-0.99.8, so won't work with older versions (although
          your old pygtk programs will still work).
        - Added support quit handlers and input handlers.
        - Fixed a long standing bug in idle/timeout/quit function reactivation.
          Before, in order for an idle or timeout function to be reactivated,
          it needed to call idle_add or timeout_add again. Now they just have
          to return TRUE (like in C).  This simplifies these functions
          substantially.  The old behaviour still works.
          If you are using gtk+-0.99.7, you will find that timeout handlers
          don't work.  This is caused by a bug in GTK, which was fixed in
          gtk+-0.99.8.
        - Found that GtkPixamp.__init__, GtkCList.set_pixtmap and GtkCList.
          set_pixtext all kept references to the pixmaps when they shouldn't.
          This is now fixed.
        - Added the module GtkExtra, which contains some convenience routines
          for writing pygtk programs.  It includes an implementation of the
          menu factory (allows creation of arbitrary sized menus with about
          four function calls), and single function call interfaces for
          handling message boxes, file selection dialogs and input boxes.
        - Added the module GDK.py, that contains relevant constants from GDK.
          It is automatically imported by Gtkinter, so it is possible to do
          things like widget.set_events(GDK.ALL_EVENTS_MASK)
        - Added a crude integrated development environment (pyide.py) that
          pulls together the debugger, profiler, console and editor examples
          in the examples/ide directory.
        - Added a function colour_alloc (or color_alloc) that can be used to
          allocate new colours for use in the text widget and others.
        - Added the drag and drop functions (finally).  Check the example in
          testgtk.py for the details.
        - Added GtkWidget.shape_combine_mask, which takes a pixmap as its first
          argument, and uses its mask as the shape mask.
	- Added the GtkCList.{set,get}_row_data functions.

pygtk-0.3.0:  10-Mar-1998
        - Updated for gtk+-0.99.4.  This means that it will not compile
          properly with previous versions.  These incompatibilities are
          justified since according to the authors of gtk, gtk+-0.99.4 is
          very close to what 1.0.0 will look like.
        - Joined the reference counting revolution :)  This doesn't affect
          anyone's programs, since reference counting (like type casting) is
          handled automatically by pygtk.
        - Check out the examples/ide directory.  It contains a Gtkinter front
          end to the python debugger and profiler and also a graphical
          python console (which now works with different fonts and everything.
        - Added more of the functions I left out from previous versions.  I
          still haven't fiddled round with dnd yet.
        - Fixed the gtk_object_get function (I had an '=' instead of a '==').
          You can now use Gtkinter objects as dictionaries.  An example is
               >>> win = GtkWindow(WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)
               >>> # next line is equivalent to win['GtkWindow::title'] = 'a'
               >>> win.set_title("a")
               >>> win['GtkWindow::title']
               'a'
        - Added the object data facility.  You can use GtkObject.set_data,
          get_data and remove_data to manipulate it.
        - Added gtk_window_set_icon and gtk_window_set_icon_name.  They are
          wrappers for the gdk counterparts.  The functions are also exposed
          in Gtkinter as GtkWindow.set_icon[_name].  The set_icon function
          takes a GtkPixmap as its argumnet, extracts the GdkPixmap and mask
          from it and calls gtk_object_sink on the GtkPixmap, in case it never
          gets packed in another widget.
        - Similar wrappers are given for GtkCList.set_pixmap and
          GtkCList.set_pixtext.  Once again, you pass a GtkPixmap instead of
          a GdkPixmap/GdkBitmap pair.

pygtk-0.2.0: 12-Feb-1998
        - Fixed tooltips properly this time.  Now you need to keep a reference
          to the GtkTooltips object for as long as you want to display those
          tips.
        - Added the example examples/testgtk/testgtk.py.  This is a
          translation of the example with the same name that comes with the
          gtk distribution.  The plus side of this is that I found and fixed
          many bits of pygtk that were either broken or missing.  (eg.
          getting the selection of a list, connecting signals for a toolbar)
        - Added an example of using trees (examples/ide/browse.py).  This one
          shows how you might set up a file manager where you only create
          as much of the tree as you are using.
        - Altered the signal handling behaviour so that the arguments to
          a signal handler are converted to their Gtkinter equivalents.
        - Pygtk should be complete enough for writing applications the size of
          ones you might use guile-gtk for, and as far as I know is the most
          complete out of the other python-gtk bindings I know of.

pygtk-0.1.1:  4-Feb-1998
        - I accidentally broke tooltips in the previous version in such a way
          that you would get a seg fault when creating a GtkTooltips object.
          This has been fixed.
        - Added a new example called gtkcons.py.  This is a simple interactive
          Python session in a GTK window.  Currently it has some bugs, the
          most prominent being that the first character of output from a
          command remains hidden until the next command is executed.  It
          also demonstrates GtkHandleBox's.

pygtk-0.1.0:  2-Feb-1998
        - Changed the copyright to LGPL.  (There is no point in making it
          more free, since this is the lisence on GTK itself).
        - Integrated some changes sent in by Neil Schemenauer
          <nascheme@acs.ucalgary.ca>.  (Mainly spelling mistakes in
          Gtkinter.py, and a number of extra examples).  The new examples
          are TAppli*.py and notebook.py.
        - Updated package for gtk+-0.99.3.  (updates include addition of
          GtkCList, GtkCombo, GtkHandleBox, GtkStatusbar and GtkToolbar).
        - Updated the GTK.py, the constants module.
        - Updated the GtkStyle and GdkEvent types.  You can now get the
          different colours of a style, and you can access the relevant
          information associated with a given type of GdkEvent.  This means
          that you can now use signals that look at button clicks or key
          strokes.
        - Added support for GtkAcceleratorTable and GtkTooltips in
          Gtkinter.py.  The types GdkColor, GdkEvent, GdkFont and GtkStyle
          don't have wrappers, but are clean enough to be used without any.
        - Added the GtkText.insert method.  There is also a
          GtkText.insert_defaults that takes a single string argument.

pygtk-0.0.2: 21-Jan-1998
        - Added file Gtkinter.py.  This gives an object oriented
          interface to gtk accessable from Python.  This is still not
          quite complete.
        - Added some example programs in the examples directory
        - Decided to release the code -- I wonder if anyone will use it?

pygtk-0.0.1: (never released)
        - first release
        - contains basic functionality of gtk through use of SWIG
