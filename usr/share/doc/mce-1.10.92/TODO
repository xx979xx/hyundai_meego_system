GENERIC:
	- stay-on doesn't seem to work?!

	- Handle display type = 0 properly!

	- Make ALS setup a 0-timeout read instead of using
	  als_read_value_filtered()

	- Replace use of *_submode_int32() with datapipe if feasible

	- Merge ALS and proximity sensor into modules/sensors.c

	- Fix event-input.c to use
	  /dev/input/{ts,keypad,jack,gpio-keys,pwr_button,mice}
	  where possible

	- Use g_try_malloc() instead of g_malloc()

	- Add support for new functionality to mcetorture
	  | power save mode

	- Add function to mce-hal to enumerate features for different
	  products (flicker key, home key, keyboard, etc.)

	- Add code to datapipe.c to ensure that datapipes never end up
	  called recursively

	- Audit the code to ensure that no datapipe triggers or filters
	  execute datapipes directly; if this cannot be avoided, it needs
	  to be verified to be safe

	- Use string pointer comparisons instead of strcmp() wherever
	  possible; be sure to internalise strings to enable this

	- Add option for proximity sensor policy both for incoming calls
	  and calls in progress

	- Add option to not use systemui tklock if kp + ts irqs are
	  disabled and immediate blanking is enabled

	- Before ALS is fully tuned or if brightness setting isn't
	  available, use 40%

	- Turn powerkey.c, tklock.c into proper modules

	- Unify lens cover and camera popout code
	  | Move camera popout detection to event-switches,
	  | and overload the lens cover pipe for this, thereby
	  | ensuring consistent behaviour across hardware.
	  | Also rename the configuration option CameraPopoutUnlock
	  | in mce.ini to something more sensible, and enable it
	  | by default
	  | keep the camera active code in the camera module

	- Update mce manual for GConf keys

	- Fix maximum_display_brightness in the filters
	  | Make it possible to use range 1-<max brightness>
	  | if the ALS has been disabled
	  || Get brightness range from GConf, convert to percentage,
	  || use in filter_brightness_simple
	  || Non-linearity can then be achieved simply by using a 1-100%
	  || range and only providing discrete steps in the app

	- Make minimum brightness for RX34 2% of maximum?

	- Add option to allow the keyboard/keypad backlight stay on as
	  long as the keyboard is open and the display is on

	- Find some way to make sure audio etc. is disabled
	  | maybe save old profile and request silent profile,
	  | then restore?


FIXME:
	- mce-modules needs to make use of the module_info


ACTIVITY:
	- Make activity sources configurable with path + values
	  instead of hardcoding them


HACKS:
	- "Silent" tklock; no tklock UI, only disable touchscreen
	  and keypad (to allow mediaplayer to continue playing)


CONFIGURABILITY:
	- Check ranges for return values


RELIABILITY:
	- Check for superfluous D-Bus arguments
	- Return proper D-Bus errors


DOCUMENTATION:
	- Manual page for mce.ini


CLEANUP:

OPEN ISSUES:
	- Should we unref dbus-messages or not after an OOM?

	- Failure cases for D-Bus, GConf, etc.?
