(*
 * Module: Xinetd
 *   Parses xinetd configuration files
 *
 *  The structure of the lens and allowed attributes are ripped directly
 *  from xinetd's parser in xinetd/parse.c in xinetd's source checkout
 *  The downside of being so precise here is that if attributes are added
 *  they need to be added here, too. Writing a catchall entry, and getting
 *  to typecheck correctly would be a huge pain.
 *
 *  A really enterprising soul could tighten this down even further by
 *  restricting the acceptable values for each attribute.

   *       not computationally feasible, even if we didn't have to worry
