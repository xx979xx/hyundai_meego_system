D-Bus GLib Bindings 0.71 (24 July 2006)
==
- Correctly installs a few missing headers
- Build was cleaned up a bit

D-Bus GLib Bindings 0.70 (17 July 2006)
==
- First release after bindings split
- dbus-binding-tool heeds org.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.ClientCSymbol C symbol
  name annotations when generating glib client bindings
- DBusGProxy can now be inherited from
- Support added for generating bindings to arrays that are represented as 
  GPtrArrays rather than GArrays (ie size-variable things, such as strings, 
  objects, structs, etc).
- Modification of the existing specialised types to have N type parameters 
  (rather than the current 1 or 2 for arrays and dictionaries respectively).
  You can then use this to get a glib type to represent any arbitrary
  D-Bus struct type using dbus_g_type_get_struct. The only implementation of 
  these types is with GValueArrays as before, but it's now possible to store 
  these in arrays, emit them in signals, etc.
- New methodbus_g_connection_open provides a way to open connections to an 
  arbitrary address
- Various bugs and memory leaks fixed
Sleep after starting the peer server, before starting the peer client.
This fixes random failures due to the race.
