0.7.2 - 2010-06-22
  - new API call aug_setm to set/create multiple nodes simultaneously
  - record expression used in a defvar underneath /augeas/variables
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Group: add test for disabled account (Raphael Pinson)
    * Grub: handle comments within a boot stanza
    * Iptables: also look for /etc/iptables-save (Nicolas Valcarcel)
    * Modules_conf: new lens for /etc/modules.conf (Matt Booth)
    * Securetty: added handling of emtpy lines/comments (Frederik Wagner)

      space-separated words as lists (Frederik Wagner)

0.7.1 - 2010-04-21
  - new primitive lens 'value' to set value of a node to a constant,
    similar to 'label' for the key (see http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html)
  - new builtins for printing and getting the types of a lens (see
    http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html)
  - add unit type to lens language; allow '_' as an identifier in let's to
    force evaluation for side effect only
  - Various fixes for Solaris. Augeas now builds cleanly on Solaris 5.10,
    and most of the tests pass. The three tests that fail all fail because
    the test scripts have Linux idiosyncrasies. This needs to be addressed
    in a future release. Much thanks to Dagobert Michelsen and the OpenCSW
    project (http://www.opencsw.org/) for providing me with access to their
    build farm.
  - fix crash when recursive lens was used in a nonrecursive lens (bug #100)
  - context free parser/recursive lenses: handle 'l?' properly (bug #119);
    distinguish between successful parse and parse with an error at end of
    input; do caller filtering to avoid spurious ambiguous parses with
    grammars containing epsilon productions
  - aug_get: return -1 when multiple nodes match (bug #121)
  - much better error message when iteration stops prematurely during
    put/create than the dreaded 'Short iteration'
  - augtool: ignore empty lines from stdin; report error when get fails
  - fix memory leak in file_info (transform.c); this was leaking a file
    name every time we loaded a file (Laine Stump)
  - nicer error message when typechecker spots ambiguity in atype
  - libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly
  - locale independence: handle a literal '|' properly on systems that lack
    use_locale
  - bootstrap: pull in isblank explicitly (needed on Solaris)
  - src/lens.c (lns_check_rec): fix refcounting mistake on error path (bug #120)
  - fix SEGV when loading empty files
  - improvements in handling some OOM's
  - Lens changes/additions
    * Approx: lens and test for the approx proxy server (Tim Stoop)

    * Logrotate: tolerate whitespace at the end of a line (bug #101); files
      can be separated by newlines (bug #104) (Raphael Pinson)
    * Modprobe: Suse includes (Frederik Wagner)
    * Nagisocfg: lens and test for /etc/nagios3/nagios.cfg (Tim Stoop)

    * Passwd: parse NIS entries on Solaris
    * Securetty: new lens and test for /etc/securetty (Simon Josi)
    * Shellvars: handle a bare 'export VAR'; Suse includes (Frederik
      Wagner); allow spaces after/before opening/closing parens for array
    * Sshd: allow optional arguments in subsystem commands (Matt Palmer)
    * Sudoers: allow del_negate even if no negate_node is found (bug #106)
               (Raphael Pinson); accept 'secure_path' (BZ 566134) (Stuart
               Sears)

0.7.0 - 2010-01-14
  - Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
    is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
    lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.
  - Support for case-insensitive regular expressions. Simply append 'i' to
    a regexp literal to make it case-insensitive, e.g. /hello/i will match
    all variations of hello, regardless of case.
  - Major revamp of augtool. In particular, path expressions don't need to
    be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.
  - Check during load/save that each file is only matched by one transform
    under /augeas/load. If there are multiple transforms for a file, the
    file is skipped.
  - New error codes AUG_ENOLENS and AUG_EMXFM
  - Do not choke on non-existing lens during save
  - Change the metadata for files under /augeas/files slightly: the node
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens now has the name of the lens used to load the
    file; the source location of that lens has moved to
    /augeas/files/$PATH/lens/info
  - New public functions fa_nocase, fa_is_nocase, and fa_expand_nocase in
    libfa
  - Various smaller bug fixes, performance improvements and improved error

    error details in a variety of places
  - Path expressions: add regexp matching; add operator '|' to form union
    of nodesets (ticket #89)

  - Clean up interface for libfa; the interface is now considered stable

    transforms marked with autoload are reported under /augeas/load
  - New flag AUG_NO_LOAD for aug_init to keep it from loading files on
    startup; add --noload option to augtool
  - New API calls aug_defvar and aug_defnode to define variables for
    path expressions; exposed as 'defvar' and 'defnode' in augtool
  - Lenses distributed with Augeas are now installed in
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses/dist, which is searched after
    /usr/share/augeas/lenses, so that lenses installed by other packages
    take precedence
  - New program examples/fadot to draw various finite automata (Francis
    Giraldeau)
  - Report line number and character offset in the tree when parsing a

  - Bug fixes in path expressions
    * for numbers, the meaning of '<' and '<=' was reversed
  - Always create an entry /files in aug_init

0.3.5 - 2008-12-23
  - add an option to rewrite files by overwriting their contents instead of
    putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents

    to aug_init, aug_save would always fail

0.3.3 - 2008-10-24
  - restore the behavior of aug_save; in 0.3.2, aug_save broke API by
    returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

0.3.2 - 2008-10-21
  - saving now reports which files were actually changed in
    /augeas/events/saved; aug_save also returns the number of files
    that were changed
  - preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
  - make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
    in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
  - report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
    is not allowed by the lens
  - quietly append a newline to files that do not have one

    O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
    manipulate for example /etc/hosts files with 65k lines
  - Handle character escapes '\x' in regular expressions in compliance with
    Posix ERE
  - aug_mv: fix bug when moving at the root level
  - Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
  - Typecheck del lens: for 'del RE STR', STR must match RE
  - Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
    '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
    produce tree nodes.

      deleting them

  - Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
    concatenation and iteration
  - Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
    '-c' flag
  - Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
    quite a few stupid and subtle problems
  - Greatly improved libfa performance to make typechecking reasonably
    fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
    seconds

0.0.6 - 2008-03-05
  - Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without
    backups
  - Take the filesystem root as an optional argument to aug_init
  - Expose these two things as command line options in augtool

0.0.5 - 2008-03-05
  - Changed public API to contain explicit reference to augeas_t
    structure. This makes it easier to write threadsafe code using Augeas
  - Added libfa, finite automata library, though it's not yet used by
    Augeas

0.0.4 - 2008-02-25
  - package as RPM and make sure Augeas can be build on Fedora/RHEL

0.0.3 - 2008-02-25
  - further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
    more closely
  - major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
    multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
  - move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
    enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:
  - completely reworked
  - processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
    structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:
  - First release.
  - Public API and basic tree data structure.
  - Record scanning works.
  - Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
  - Simple tests and test driver
