OpenSync Framework
==================

OpenSync is a plugin-based application that basically provides a framework
for syncing groups which can have two or more members. These members could
be just about any kind of database we have a plugin like:

 - A folder filled with vcard files containing contacts (file-sync) 
 - An LDAP server having a huge list of contacts (ldap-sync) 
 - An application like Mozilla Sunbird or Google Calendar managing calendars 
 - A PIM (Personal Information Management) like Ximian Evolution or KDE PIM 
 - A mobile phone which hosts contacts/ calendars/ notes

OpenSync is not only limited to sync PIM data.

The technical aspects of how the synchronisation is implemented can befound
in this document [2] or in the OpenSync whitepaper stored in docs/ Each
device has its own way of storing information and the purpose of OpenSync
is to extract this information and provide inconvertibility using an
XML intermediate. OpenSync without any plugins is incapable of doing any
synchronisation.

Installation
============

To build OpenSync you need CMake, (check for unit tests - optional) and
the devel packages of sqlite3, glib2, and libxml2. swig for python bindings
(optional). We only support out of source builds, which means you have to
create a sperated build directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix /path/to/opensync/source/
make
make install
