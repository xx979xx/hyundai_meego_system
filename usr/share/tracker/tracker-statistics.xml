   The "id" input parameters can represent, in the case of a file, the
   full path and name of the file. In other cases, "id" can also be a
   unique name or URI for the specified service.

   The "id" field uniquely identifies an entity in Tracker regardless
   of its service type. The live_query_id parameters in some search
   and retrieval methods is used to indicate whether the query should
   be "live". Liveness means the query can receive signals in real
   time to remove hits that are no longer valid and add new ones that
   are. These signals are emitted in response to file or volume
   notifications. A value of -1 should be passed if live query
   functionality is not desired. A live_query_id can be obtained in
   the future from the LiveQuery Interface.
