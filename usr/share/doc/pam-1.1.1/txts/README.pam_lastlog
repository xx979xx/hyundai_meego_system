pam_lastlog — PAM module to display date of last login

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DESCRIPTION

pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about the last
login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the /var/log/lastlog file.

Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such cases, this
module is not necessary.

    Don't inform the user about any previous login, just update the /var/log/
    lastlog file.

    If the /var/log/lastlog file does not contain any old entries for the user,
    indicate that the user has never previously logged in with a welcome
    message.
