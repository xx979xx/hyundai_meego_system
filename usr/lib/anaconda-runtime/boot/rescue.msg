                        01Rescue Mode Help07

The installer includes a rescue mode which can be used when a system
does not boot properly.  The rescue mode includes many useful
utilities (editor, hard drive and RAID tools, etc.) which will allow
one to restore a system to a working state.

To enter the rescue mode, boot your system from the installation
CDROM or floppy and type 01linux rescue <ENTER>07.
