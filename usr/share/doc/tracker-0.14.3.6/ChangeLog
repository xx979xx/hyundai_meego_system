	Release 0.14.2

	tracker-search: Fix man page so EXPRESSION is not directly linked to options
	Fixes GB#679313

	libtracker-miner: Make reentry maximum (2) a #define and update error given

	libtracker-miner: Don't conditionally unref blocker file if queue was set up

2012-07-05  Sam Thursfield  <sam.thursfield@codethink.co.uk>

	libtracker-miner: Avoid stalling when blocking file is dropped due to errors

	libtracker-miner: Prevent stalling if we drop the last queued file

	libtracker-miner: Protect against infinite loops
	When we defer processing on an item, set a counter in its qdata to
	prevent the miner ever becoming stuck in an infinite loop.

	Fixes GB#676435 and GB#674869

	libtracker-miner: Remove unneeded call to item_queue_handlers_set_up()
	item_add_or_update_cb() does not usually need to call this function as
	the item queue is not stopped while waiting for extraction tasks. We
	do need to call it if the queues are empty to ensure a QUEUE_NONE
	event is processed.

	libtracker-miner: Prevent item queue handlers from running when blocked
	If we pop the next item from a queue and find that either that file or
	its parent is still being processed, the item queue handler must wait
	until the outstanding tasks finish and are committed.

	In this case we stop the item_queue_handlers_cb() timeout from
	executing, but it is often restarted early as there are many triggers
	for item_queue_handlers_set_up(), and the callback then pops the file
	again, discovers it is still blocked and reenqueues it. This is a waste
	of time and also makes it hard to implement infinite loop detection
	reliably.

	We now remember the file that is blocking progress, and
	item_queue_handlers_set_up() will not start the item queue handlers
	until sparql_buffer_task_finished_cb() has been called for the file
	in question.

	miners/fs: Correctly remove failed extractions from queue
	Correctly remove task from extraction queue if g_file_query_info_async()
	fails.

	This bug prevents failsafe extraction from starting in some cases, which
	in turn means that the miner may eventually stall due to the extraction
	queue being full.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Fix invalid pointer access
	gst_tag_list_get_string() does not initialise the output pointer to
	NULL if there is no value for that tag. In some cases, neither do we
	which leads to invalid string pointers and the occasional segfault
	when processing files with no tags.

	In tracker-file-notifier.c:indexing_tree_directory_removed() we don't
	remove the directory from priv->pending_index_roots, unless it's the
	current indexing root.

	If it's a USB mountpoint, the GFile gets freed before we get around to
	crawling it, so all hell breaks loose.

	libtracker-miner: Prevent double unref of cached GFile objects
	The reference owned by the TrackerFileSystem cache may be removed
	more than once. Add a flag to ensure that the cache will only ever
	unref it once, even if it is being kept alive in the cache by
	references held elsewhere in the code.

	tracker_file_system_delete_files() is renamed to
	tracker_file_system_forget_files() to avoid confusion.

	Fixes GB#676849

2012-06-11  Sam Thursfield  <sam.thursfield@codethink.co.uk>

	libtracker-extract: Fix GCancellable deadlock
	Triggering one cancellable in another's callback is a bad idea, because
	these objects share a single global mutex. This can be triggered by
	removing a USB stick during the extraction process.

	There's no real need to use two separate cancellables for the same
	file here.

	Fixes GB#676433.

	sftp://.

	Fixes GB#672308.

	evolution: Fixed includes ... yet again
	So I have this time put each include in separate sections. The logic was
	getting too complicated and it was hard to maintain. This is why single
	include files make so much sense.

	I've checked each release of the libraries we import from and the files do
	exist for each of the versions we support.

	I removed the camel include because all the Evolution includes include that
	already.

	I also removed the include for older than 2.91 versions which didn't exist
	there and was reported under the bug below.

	libtracker-miner: Ensure we deal with the canonical copy on ::directory-removed
	A mismatch could result in tracker_crawler_stop() not being called, even if the

	libtracker-miner: don't put sparql for missing/cancelled files
	This behavior is analogous to 0.10. The miner has to allow lesser
	errors and insert minimal sparql for the files, but this kind of

	   encodings are not expected to have NUL bytes within the string).
	 * If locale encoding is not UTF-8, try with the locale encoding.
	 * If locale encoding didn't help, try with windows-1252.

	Fixes GB#655383.

	libtracker-miner: honor TRACKER_DIRECTORY_FLAG_CHECK_MTIME
	TrackerFileNotifier won't do mtime checks for files coming from
	initial crawling, if the check is result of a monitor event, it
	will be performed anyway.

	tracker-miner-fs: respect the crawling-interval setting
	mtime checks will only be performed on configuration directories
	according to this setting.

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't add directories to index too eagerly
	ensure_mount_point_exists() is expected to create the sparql for
	a mount point directory, not having it added to the
	TrackerIndexingTree.

	libtracker-miner: Use interned GFiles in TrackerIndexingTree signals
	This is so callers may rely on equality instead of g_file_equal(), fixes
	cancel-crawling-on-unmount in TrackerFileNotifier.

2011-12-07  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Check the ignored flag in tracker_indexing_tree_file_is_indexable()
	It should obviously be non-indexable if its config root has that flag set.

	tracker-store: Finalize the TrackerDBusRequests on blank updates
	This was likely to leave stuck resources for already disconnected clients
	in the tracker-store side.

	tests: Add TrackerFileNotifier file monitoring tests

	tests: Add tests for TrackerFileNotifier configuration changes

	libtracker-miner: Handle directories with IGNORED flag being removed
	In this case, the directory could be reindexed if it's in another indexed
	location.

	libtracker-miner: Initialize TrackerDirectoryFlags to NONE in any case
	This is so calling tracker_indexing_tree_get_root() on an unindexed file
	doesn't end up with uninitialized memory as flags.

	libtracker-miner: Set indexing tree in the file monitor
	This is so monitor events on unhandled files is blocked early.

	libtracker-miner: issue critical warning on unlikely case
	This shouldn't ever happen, but issue a warning in case some
	bug slips in.

	libtracker-miner: Fix gir generation warnings

	libtracker-miner: Fix possibly wrong progress reporting
	There's a slim window between the miner calling ::process-file
	on the last remaining file and process_stop() where the progress
	would be wrongly reported as 0%

	libtracker-miner: Allow GFiles to be part of several TrackerFileSystem
	This could be needed in the future.

	libtracker-miner: Avoid frequent sync calls
	TrackerCrawler now is able to retrieve GFileInfos with a given
	set of attributes, avoiding the need in TrackerFileNotifier
	to g_file_query_info() when traversing the file tree returned
	on ::directory-crawled.

	tests: Add beginning of unit test for TrackerFileNotifier
	ATM only crawling is tested, file monitoring and changing
	configurations should be eventually tested as well

	libtracker-miner: Add back the code removing thumbnail/albumart
	The mimetype isn't needed there after all.

	libtracker-miner: rephrase code comment
	It'd be indeed good to have tracker-miner-fs monitor directories
	triggering a TRACKER_FILTER_PARENT_DIRECTORY filter in case that
	situation changes (ie. the file triggering the filter disappears),
	but given Tracker has never behaved like that and noone ever
	complained, lower the comment severity a bit, it's not something
	we should rush on.

	libtracker-miner: Remove useless code
	This branch of code would never be executed in practice,
	as TrackerFileNotifier can't ever emit ::item-moved on
	an unknown file.

	libtracker-miner: handle moving dirs from recursive to non-recursive locations
	TrackerMinerFS now checks the TrackerDirectoryFlags for source/dest locations,
	triggering a bulk delete operation on the directory children if it's moved
	to a non recursive location

	libtracker-miner: Traverse children selectively in TrackerFileSystem
	Now, returning FALSE in the TrackerFileSystemTraverseFunc given to
	tracker_file_system_traverse() means the node will not be recursed,
	but the traversal will still continue.

	This deviates a bit from g_node_traverse, but makes more sense given
	the common operations in a filesystem representation.

	This is now used in TrackerMinerFS to stop traversal on deleted
	folders.

	libtracker-miner: Avoid critical warning
	The extraction timer could be unset if the miner doesn't
	get to process any file between start/stop.

	libtracker-miner: Adapt commit e60fc84e6 to TrackerFileNotifier
	The mtimes are now stored as guint64, and a 2 seconds tolerance is
	used to determine whether the file changed, so lack of precision
	doesn't trigger spurious updates in FAT filesystems.

	libtracker-miner: Calculate remaining time purely on extraction time
	During crawling, the extraction queue may be mostly empty, but adding
	up time that makes the remaining time calculations to be quite off
	when little items have been processed so far.

	So, keep a timer only for extraction time, which can be used for more
	accurate measurements, as only extraction is left when tracker-miner-fs
	gets to report progress/remaining time.

	libtracker-miner, notifier: report again status when crawling
	This brings back the "Crawling directory '...'" messages reported
	via the Status DBus property.

	libtracker-miner: Remove fs->priv->is_crawling
	This is replaced by tracker_file_notifier_is_active()

	libtracker-miner, notifier: Check dir roots with the canonical copy in TrackerFileSystem

	libtracker-miner: Remove deleted folders from being tracked
	Directories are now removed from the TrackerFileSystem if a delete
	monitor event happens on a dir.

	libtracker-miner: Optimize TrackerFileSystem insertions/deletions
	We rely on the crawler to provide files in-order, so don't unnecessarily
	try to reparent child nodes that were added earlier. Also optimize
	insertion where a parent is provided.

	libtracker-miner: Cancel sparql query in TrackerFileNotifier when crawling stops

	libtracker-miner: Handle correctly crawling on just created dirs
	The crawler check was wrong for directories added due to a monitor
	created event, so ensure harder that we're dealing with a config
	root instead of some random dir.

	libtracker-miner: Do not delete files while traversing the file tree
	Instead, use tracker_file_system_delete_files(), which also avoids the
	need to store the GFileType as filesystem data.

	libtracker-miner: Fix problems with directories going out and into config again
	Remove the queried/crawled flags before possibly reindexing a dir tree for the
	second time (i.e. mounts). Also, check correctly the pending index roots when
	a dir is added or removed.

	tracker-miner-fs: Remove the preserve flag if a dir is removed from config
	We don't want to know anymore about that directory, even if it happened
	to be within a mount point

	tracker-miner-fs: Fix some TrackerDirectoryFlags passed on mounts
	Some flags were missing, others wrongly overwritten

	libtracker-miner: lower message log level
	Having a root directory changing flags may be a normal operation,
	so don't show a warning

	libtracker-miner: Ensure TrackerFileSystem has a meaningful file type
	tracker_file_system_get_file() will be called several times on the
	same file, so store the first meaningful GFileType gotten through
	that call.

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_file_system_delete_files()
	This function recursively deletes files of a given GFileType,
	or every file if G_FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN.

	libtracker-miner: Ensure the timer is set on ::directory-started

	libtracker-miner: Fix invalid read in TrackerFileSystem

	tracker-miner-fs: Remove commented code

	libtracker-miner: Untangle filesystem refcount over GFiles
	TrackerFileSystem actually owns a reference to the contained GFiles,
	it just expect an external g_object_unref() call over these to
	manage the associated GNode.

	libtracker-miner: Fix typo
	node_free() in tracker-indexing-tree.c is meant to
	be a GNodeTraverseFunc.

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not use tracker_miner_fs_directory_remove*
	Instead use tracker_indexing_tree_remove() directly.

	libtracker-miner: Avoid IRI queries on parents of config dirs

	libtracker-miner: Reimplement tracker_miner_fs_directory_remove*
	These functions now just call tracker_indexing_tree_remove(),
	every cancellation is now done in the signal handler.

	libtracker-miner: Make filesystem properties registration global
	This is so GDestroyNotify for set properties is available at the
	time of destructing a file node.

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not use old API to add/recheck dirs

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_indexing_tree_list_roots()
	This function retrieves the configured roots, the flags can be
	later queried with tracker_indexing_tree_get_root() on these
	files.

	libtracker-miner: Listen to ::directory-updated in TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerIndexingTree::directory-updated

	libtracker-miner: plug some leaks

	libtracker-miner: Remove unused vmethods from TrackerMinerFS
	This touches public API, but these signals aren't emitted anymore as
	TrackerIndexingTree provides all necessary information.

	libtracker-miner: Use level order when traversing the filesystem tree
	This is most similar to how TrackerMinerFS used to work, and results in
	less "miner stopped due to parent being indexed" situations than
	G_PRE_ORDER.

	tests: Fix filesystem test, TrackerFile is gone

	libtracker-miner: Obey "ignored" directory flag in TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Fix compiler warnings

	libtracker-miner: Stop crawler if it matches a config dir being removed

	libtracker-miner: Handle root config directories being deleted.

	libtracker-miner: Improve a bit reference counting on TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Add a "preserve in store" flag for config dirs
	And use it for mounts, so the info is preserved in the store, and
	only tracker:available is unset in TrackerMinerFiles.

	libtracker-miner: Remove indexing tree signal handlers in TrackerMinerFS
	tracker_miner_fs_directory_add*() is meant to use TrackerIndexingTree
	underneath, so don't do it the other way around too.

	libtracker-miner: Only emit ::file-deleted on folders for the toplevel being deleted

	libtracker-miner: Also check "config root within config root" during queries

	libtracker-miner: Improve logging of TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Add compat layer for tracker_miner_fs_directory_*
	All these functions use TrackerIndexingTree underneath now

	libtracker-miner: Remove item_query_exists() from TrackerMinerFS
	All its uses have been either removed (state is guaranteed within
	TrackerFileNotifier) or replaced by tracker_file_notifier_get_file_iri()

	libtracker-miner: Remove unused structs from TrackerMinerFS

	libtracker-miner: Remove miner_fs->priv->config_directories
	This is replaced by TrackerIndexingTree and TrackerDirectoryFlags

	libtracker-miner-fs: Add tracker_indexing_tree_file_is_root()

	libtracker-miner: Remove miner_fs->priv->directories
	All its uses have been replaced by TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Remove miner_fs->priv->crawled_directories
	It's not used anymore, replaced by TrackerFileNotifier.

	libtracker-miner: Only spare an IRI query on updated items

	libtracker-miner: Ensure the right processing order on QUEUE_WAIT situations
	Ensure the dirs we're waiting for are prepended to the queue, so they're
	processed before any later child.

	libtracker-miner: Avoid double checking root directories in TrackerFileNotifier
	If a directory happens to be both a root directory and the child of a root
	directory, it could be told to be inspected twice, only do this if this
	directory root itself is being inspected.

	libtracker-miner: Only append dirs to crawler processing on recursive dirs
	This saves some idle jumps when a directory is found on a non-recursive
	crawled dir.

	libtracker-miner: Remove dead code in TrackerMinerFS
	TrackerCrawler is not in use anymore, so remove all its signal
	handlers

	libtracker-miner: Remove IRI cache from TrackerMinerFS
	TrackerFileNotifier provides that information where necessary

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_file_notifier_get_file_iri()
	This function replaces the IRI cache in TrackerMinerFS

	libtracker-miner: Remove TrackerFile
	Instead, weak refs to GFiles are kept to manage the actual nodes
	in a TrackerFileSystem tree, this also eases TrackerFile vs GFile
	situations.

	libtracker-miner: Hook up progress/status indication to TrackerFileNotifier processing

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_file_notifier_is_active()
	Just a boolean getter telling whether the notifier is currently
	doing something

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerFileNotifier::finished
	This signal notifies when have all pending operations finished,
	if anything triggers new operations, a new ::finished signal will
	be emitted after these (i.e. there's no first vs !first index
	difference)

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerFileNotifier::directory-started/finished
	These 2 signals notify when does indexing of a config root directory, or
	a recently added directory, happens.

	libtracker-miner: Remove unused filesystem property

	libtracker-miner: Remove check for removed files during crawling
	This code is unused now, TrackerFileNotifier will issue ::file-deleted
	already for items found in the store but not during crawling.

	libtracker-miner: Remove mtime cache
	It's unused now that we have TrackerFileNotifier. Code
	has been roughly wired at places, but that code is to be
	removed soon too, so...

	libtracker-miner: Remove all trace of TrackerMonitor in TrackerMinerFS
	TrackerFileNotifier's is used instead

	libtracker-miner: Use TrackerFileNotifier in TrackerMinerFS
	Now TrackerMinerFS uses TrackerFileNotifier signals to receive
	crawler/monitor events, so now a cleanup is due here.

	libtracker-miner: Hook TrackerFileNotifier to TrackerMonitor signals

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerFileNotifier::file-moved signal

	libtracker-miner: Add "attributes_only" parameter to TrackerFileNotifer::file-updated
	This is so we use the same signal on both file and file attributes updates

	libtracker-miner: Set up monitor in TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Perform parallel querying/crawling in TrackerFileNotifier
	The query is done in one big batch to minimize latency, when the last of
	both operations end, availability/mtimes are checked in order to issue
	the corresponding signal for a file change.

	libtracker-miner: Store mtime during crawling in TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Initialize TrackerFileNotifier filesystem properties

	libtracker-miner: Fix double inserts in tracker_file_system_get_file()
	If parent was provided, no check for duplicates was done.

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_file_system_traverse()
	This function iterates over all known files, it is possible
	to provide a root to start from, or NULL.

	libtracker-miner: Create signals for TrackerFileNotifier

	libtracker-miner: Rename TrackerFileNotifier::file-added to file-created

	libtracker-miner: clear directories queue before TrackerCrawler::finished
	This is so we can call tracker_crawler_start() within the ::finished
	handler, instead of on an idle.

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerFileNotifier
	TrackerFileNotifier is meant to be a high-level object that notifies
	about any update/addition/removal affecting the indexed content of
	a miner. At the moment only basic infrastructure has been added, so
	it only crawls the contents.

	tests: Add TrackerFileSystem test suite

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerFileSystem
	This is a file system abstraction object which may provide canonical
	(and persistent) TrackerFile objects representing a file, so == and
	!= operations can be used for these.

	It is also able to store arbitrary information tied to a file.

	tracker-miner-fs: Use filter policies in TrackerMinerApplications
	Now all files are rejected, unless they match the *.desktop|*.directory
	filter

	libtracker-miner: Add default policies to TrackerIndexingTree filters
	An "accept" policy means a file is accepted unless it matches a filter,
	meanwhile a "deny" policy means files are rejected unless they match a
	filter. The default policy is "accept"

	tracker-miner-fs: Make TrackerMinerApplications use TrackerIndexingTree

	libtracker-miner: Make TrackerMinerFS use TrackerIndexingTree
	No more check-* or monitor-directory signals are emitted. Instead,
	the TrackerIndexingTree is used to determine whether files should
	be indexed.

	libtracker-miner: Implement tracker_indexing_tree_file_is_indexable on top of get_root()

	libtracker-miner: Rename tracker_indexing_tree_get_effective_parent to get_root()
	"Effective parent" is misleading since the same file could be returned, so talking
	about "configured root directories" makes somewhat more sense.

	tracker-miner-fs: Specify the index directories to TrackerIndexingTree

	tracker-miner-fs: Set TrackerIndexingTree filters in TrackerMinerFiles

	libtracker-miner: Optionally filter hidden files in TrackerIndexingTree

	libtracker-miner: Fix infinite loop

	libtracker-miner: change arguments in tracker_indexing_tree_get_parent_is_indexable()
	Now a GList is passed instead of an array.

	libtracker-miner: Add ::directory-added/removed signals to TrackerIndexingTree

2011-12-07  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner, tests: ignore built files

	libtracker-miner, tests: implement multiple cases for indexing tree add/remove.

	libtracker-miner,tests: First tests to check indexing tree capabilities

	libtracker-miner: new IGNORE flag for the indexing tree
	TRACKER_DIRECTORY_FLAG_IGNORE allows specifying a subtree to be completely
	ignored. It has the same effect as adding a new path to the tree without
	the TRACKER_DIRECTORY_FLAG_MONITOR flag.

	libtracker-miner: fix logic to tell whether file is indexable
	A file is indexable if:
	 * The exact file was added to be monitored.
	 * The direct parent directory of the file was added to be monitored.
	 * The closest configured parent directory was added to be recursively monitored.

	libtracker-miner: fix tree disposal

	libtracker-miner: Make TrackerMonitor use TrackerIndexingTree
	This is at the moment only used for event discarding, and for emitting

	The returned object is owned by the miner, and will be internally
	used to find out whether files should be processed.

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerIndexingTree
	This object holds the parameters for the indexed directories, and
	the applying filters, so can effectively tell whether a file should
	be indexed or not.

	Fixes NB#285537.
	Fixes NB#291569.

	tracker-miner-fs: Added locale checking on directories
	If not the current locale, we ignore the userguide directory, but only
	when we HAVE_MEEGOTOUCH.

	tracker-miner-fs: Detect locale changes properly in userguides miner

	tracker-miner-fs: Move tracker-miner-applications-meego to tracker-miner-meego

	tracker-miner-fs: Move tracker-miner-applications-locale to tracker-miner-locale

	tracker-miner-fs: Remove some FIXME comments and add TODO comments

	tracker-miner-fs: Avoid unnecessary string copies

2011-11-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Finishing touches on userguides miner
	- No longer get path when we don't need it per guide
	- Improve debugging
	- Remove commented out code
	- Don't allow .ini processing (only .html)

	tracker-miner-fs: Updated SPARQL generated to match more closely Files miner

	tracker-miner-fs: Added userguide extraction code
	Mostly works with the exception of a pipe leak by the looks of it.

2011-11-25  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-miner-fs: Ignore userguide directory in files miner
	Userguide miner is responsible for indexing this directory.

2011-11-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Added initial boiler plate for userguide miner
	This requires --enable-maemo to build.

2011-11-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Do not possibly leak TrackerExtractInfos

	tracker-extract,pdf: Plug a leak
	The poppler actions were being leaked. Another warning
	about invalid reads has been fixed too

	tracker-extract,albumart: Plug a leak
	The pixbuf loader was being leaked, whereas the pixbuf
	was being unref'ed, even though it's owned by the loader.

	libtracker-miner: Hook up directly to pools' state
	This way the miner is able to resume/pause as the different
	task pools notify on ::limit-reached, instead of relying
	on the pertinent item_queue_handlers_set_up() call at the
	right time.

	libtracker-extract: Deliver async result on all situations
	There were error situations that might end up on the async result
	not being called

	libtracker-extract: Made more resilient to dbus/splice failures
	Now if one of both operations fail, the other is cancelled right
	away, instead of having the petition wait forever for the other
	part to be finished, which might never happen.

	libtracker-miner: Fix buffer control in TrackerMinerFS
	Add an explicit check on item_queue_handlers_cb() to check the
	sparql buffer status, so it doesn't have an opportunity to clog
	it any further.

	libtracker-bus: Do not use GDBusProxy
	The finalizer of GDBusProxy schedules an idle function to disconnect
	the name owner changed signal. This leaks a GMainContext if the
	corresponding loop was already terminated.

	Fixes NB#285426.

	Remove posix.vapi
	Both functions are available in upstream bindings.

	Remove glib-2.0-fixes.vapi
	This was fixed upstream in Vala 0.12.0.

	SPARQL: Ensure that fn:timezone-from-dateTime returns integer

2011-11-23  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-miner: Other signed changes where it made no sense to use guint

	libtracker-miner: Change signedness of a field that is used to calculate
	The ABS() where this field was used in had a calculation that could
	result in a negative value within the ABS's brackets. Because it's
	unrealistic that we'd ever need the value of this field to be larger
	than int, we decided to just change it to signed int.

	Fixes NB#290165.

	libtracker-extract, miner-fs: Use a fallback rdf:type in case of extractor failure
	Fixes NB#290406.

	writeback: Add missing #include
	This fixes the build, which I broke in my last commit,
	oops.

	writeback: Set uniformly the same error when writeback modules don't handle the file
	Fixes NB#286656. TRACKER_DBUS_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED is used in miner/writeback
	communication when writeback doesn't handle a given RDF type, which is
	considered non-critical on the miner side. So use the same error code when
	a module refuses to handle a mimetype.

	tracker-writeback: Apply writeback handlers sequentially on a same file

	libtracker-miner,crawler: Use a cancellable per crawled directory
	Reusing the cancellable might bring in issues if tracker_crawler_start()
	(which resets the cancellable) is called shortly after tracker_crawler_stop().
	So pending async tasks that do check for g_cancellable_is_cancelled() might
	run into the wrong state. Possibly fixes NB#287480.

	The cancellable might be used to cancel the current operation, but then
	reset and reused for the next one, while the previous operation could
	still be on the way to be cancelled. Instead, create a new cancellable
	to handle any following task.

2011-09-29  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Use g_strchug() functionality to avoid allocating memory
	Previously the work from Sam just returned buffer and the returned string
	required a +9 to get past the cuesheet=, however, I thought it better to
	just move the memory in a similar way to g_strchug() so we don't allocated any
	memory and the returned value can be used straight away.

	tracker-extract: Rename public functions to prefix tracker_cue_sheet_

	tracker-extract: Fixed various coding style issues

	libtracker-extract: Bump version tracker_extract_info_get_postupdate_builder() was introduced

	libtracker-common: Remove unnecessary condition in tracker_filename_casecmp_without_extension()

	libtracker-common: Renamed function to casecmp filenames without extension
	New name is tracker_filename_casecmp_without_extension()

	build: Bump version to 0.13.0
	Note: all new libraries will have -0.14* in their names. This potentially
	breaks a few things like Firefox/Thunderbird for now.

	ontologies,tracker-extract: Rename nfo:containerStartTime to nfo:audioOffset
	Based on discussions at
	http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/nepomuk/2011-September/001860.html

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Return more metadata in 1 file==1 track cases

	tracker-extract: Avoid crash when no postupdate string

	functional-tests: Test for previous tracker-miner-fs commit

	functional-tests: Disable initial sleep of tracker-miner-fs when testing.

	tracker-miner-fs: Delete any associated logical resources when removing a file
	With the cuesheets support it's now possible to have multiple
	nie:InformationElement resources stored in one file resource. The miner must
	make sure these are correctly deleted when the file resource is removed,
	either due to the file being deleted or it being on a stale removable volume.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Remove existing tracks for a file when extracting

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Don't give each track its own URL
	Start time inside the larger container is specified now using a
	new property nfo:containerStartTime, and the track is related to the
	container nfo:FileDataObject in the standard way (nie:isStoredAs).

	This avoids problems of having a number of nfo:FileDataObject
	resources all pointing to the same file, such as duplication of
	file metadata and the need for special code to update the nie:url
	on moves/renames.

	tracker-extract: Add 'postupdate' field
	Normally in Tracker the nfo:FileDataObject resource representing a file
	and the nie:InformationElement subclasses representing its contents are
	one and the same.

	If a file contains more than one logical resource, the extractor needs
	to create these separately and link them to the file resource using
	nie:isStoredAs - this cannot be done until the file resource has been
	inserted in the store, because it is difficult to know how to refer to
	the file object. The 'postupdate' field provides a way to do this.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Fix class/property name mistakes

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Use ToC information
	Fixes GB#657183

	tracker-extract: Add libcue-based CUE sheet parser

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Pass tag list explicitly
	This allows smarter processing in future using information from cue
	sheets and other sources.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Factor out type setting code

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Break up extract_metadata() into functions

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Avoid duplicate nmm:Artist inserts
	Maintain an internal list to avoid creating more than one INSERT per
	nmm:Artist. Once CUE reading lands, a single file may contain 15 songs
	by one artist and previously this would have resulted in 15 identical
	INSERT statements in the preupdate.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Rework album info reading
	* Use GST_TAG_ALBUM_ARTIST for album artist if available (otherwise fall back
	  on performer/artist)

	* Be consistant with variable names

	* Remove unused 'scount' parameter

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Don't pass file URL needlessly
	Also some changes to avoid confusion:

	* Rename 'uri' to 'file_url' when there are lots of URIs around

	* Rename add_date_time_gst_tag() (which still uses the file URL
	  to guarantee metadata) to add_date_time_gst_tag_with_mtime_fallback()

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Simplify tagcache behaviour
	Avoid having a NULL tagcache, which allows us to use
	gst_tag_list_insert() to merge new tags.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Remove check for GST_VERSION > 0.10.20
	Tracker now requires at least 0.10.30 in any case.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Remove 'needs_audio' flag
	Refactor away this variable, it's not needed

	tracker-writeback: Propagate all errors of writeback over DBus
	All these error conditions would put miner-fs in a detect state unless
	propagated over D-Bus. Even criticals in tracker-writeback shouldn't
	leave miner-fs in a defect state (waiting for rename() to happen).

	tracker-writeback: Handle if there's no module for the passed rdf types

	tracker-writeback: Do proper error handling in the writeback program
	The writeback_file_finished in the miner-fs requires that in case no rename()
	happens at the end (which is the case in case the module's function returned
	FALSE at the end of tracker_writeback_file_update_metadata), that an error is
	returned for the DBus Method PerformWriteback.

	I encountered a situation where xmp_files_open_new returned NULL in the module
	function writeback_xmp_update_file_metadata of tracker-writeback-xmp.c, this
	resulted in a FALSE return causing a unlink instead of rename of the temporary
	file. This made miner-fs's handling for that fail.

	Revert "ontology: Remove tracker:writeback property from nao:prefLabel"
	This reverts commit 9dcee2bdc0ef2beb9be83b31180c18fb2c0ecfbd.

	Tracker-extract won't trigger anymore a writeback petition when inserting
	tags. So, even if it doesn't work yet as expected, is not harmful in normal
	operations.

	tracker-extract: use provided graph when inserting keywords from PDF documents

	tracker-extract: use provided graph when inserting keywords from PNG images

	tracker-extract: use provided graph when inserting keywords from TIFF images

	tracker-extract: use provided graph when inserting keywords from JPEG images

	tracker-extract: use provided graph when inserting keywords from GIF images

	tracker-extract: Pass the graph down to extract modules
	The passed TrackerExtractInfo will now contain the graph that should
	be used for data modifications

	tracker-extract: Add a "graph" parameter to dbus methods
	Now the requester may provide a graph, that should be used by tracker-extract
	for any insert clause it generates in the preupdate sparql builder.

	tracker-extract: Pass a TrackerExtractInfo to the exported extract function
	This struct replaces all previous arguments, with the advantage that it can
	be extended at any time, containing all necessary information for modules
	to to their work correctly.

	All modules have been changed to deal with the new function signature.

	libtracker-extract: Move TrackerExtractInfo out to its own header
	The API has changed slightly too, it is a refcounted boxed object, and
	contains TrackerSparqlBuilders for preinsert/metadata contents. This is
	so it may be passed on to extract modules.

	Current users of TrackerExtractInfo have been modified to deal with the
	API change.

	libtracker-sparql: Allow append() on embedded inserts in TrackerSparqlBuilder
	The result() method was returning nothing for these if only append() is used
	to introduce content in a TrackerSparqlBuilder created through the embedded_insert()
	constructor.

2011-09-06  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Improve query performance for updating tracker:available on mounting
	Previously we had an OPTIONAL and FILTER in the query. This translated into
	quite a delay when updating even a small number of resources in the database
	and subsequently affected the crawling speed upon re-mounting.

	Given we don't *ever* expect there to be resources for the given
	nie:dataSource which are in the wrong tracker:available state, we don't need
	the OPTIONAL or FILTER there.

	This fixes NB#272441

2011-09-06  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract,gstreamer: if possible, use Tagreadbin backend in the Discoverer
	By default, the GUPnP-DLNA and GStreamer discoverers use Decodebin2 backend to

	functional-tests: Make quiet by default
	Add -v / --verbose option, which enables output of the helper status
	messages and also stdin/stderr of the tracker processes being tested.

	functional-tests: Run all tests with a fake $HOME sandbox
	Prefer storing test data in /tmp to avoid leaving cruft around the
	home directory.

	For tests that rely on filesystem monitoring, we must use the real
	home directory anyway because FS miner currently ignores paths under
	/tmp.

	If /tmp is too small/unsuitable for test data, the preferred method
	for using a different location is to set TMPDIR.

	functional-tests: Refactor common/utils/helpers.py
	* Add Helper base class.

	* New setup behaviour: start() runs the process and blocks until it is
	  available on the bus. connect() and wait() are removed.

	* A new process is always explicitly spawned, instead of relying on DBus
	  activation. This allows passing environment variables to the tracker
	  processes being tested, regardless of whether they are being run in
	  the session dbus or a nested bus from test-helper.sh.

	* common/utils/system.py: use Helper instead of our own LifeCycle
	  classes because they now do the same thing.

	* StoreHelper: don't try to respawn the tracker-store unless it actually
	  has disappeared from the bus - other exceptions are now passed to the
	  caller.

	All tests fixed for new behaviour.

	functional-tests: Run tests inside an isolated DBus instance

2011-08-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	ontology: Remove tracker:writeback property from nao:prefLabel
	Fixes NB#278806, this property only applies to nao:Tag entities, not
	on files, so whenever a file with XMP keywords was added, the insertion
	of the keywords would trigger a writeback petition in the miner. This
	would add a writeback task that would issue a costly query only to find
	out it doesn't directly affect any nfo:FileDataObject.

	If several files with these characteristics were created, the effect
	would be multiplied as writeback petitions would be requested faster
	than delivered, filling the writeback queue and hence blocking any
	other processing.

	tracker-extract: Make sure we check filtered modules for dbus calls too
	The --force-module command line option was ignored for dbus calls and only
	available for command line use.

	tracker-extract: Improve checks for mimetype guessing
	Previously mimetype had to be NULL, but over dbus, it can only be an empty
	string. The check has been improved here.

	Additionally, we were leaking a GSimpleAsyncResult.

	There was also an issue with error conditions of the mimetype check where we
	would return and the client would be left hanging because we didn't complete
	the simple_async_result in that condition. That's now been fixed and any error
	reported by getting the mimetype also reported back to the client.

	Add AX_DOTS_TO_UNDERSCORES macro to allow independent
	TRACKER_API_VERSION_UNDERSCORES value (which is used to convert "0.12" to
	"0_12".

	We need this because for 0.11.x releases, we want the files to be named *0.12*
	which requires changing only tracker_api_version in configure. This breaks
	Makefiles which build introspection files because they use
	$TRACKER_MAJOR_VERSION_$TRACKER_MINER_VERSION and that's not updated.
	Additionally, $TRACKER_API_VERSION can't be used because it contains a dot not
	an underscore. The only way to fix this was to do it in configure.

	libtracker-miner: check writeback task pool when translating MOVED events to CREATED
	A move event from an ignored file to a non-ignored one will be translated to a CREATED
	event, So check first whether there are no writeback tasks for the "new" file, since
	this is a common operation.

	libtracker-miner: Ensure no items are left to process after writeback

	libtracker-miner: Separate writeback tasks to their own task pool
	Tasks now have a gboolean* as the data, indicating whether the task
	was already notified or not, the code hooking to the monitor events
	has been modified so the UPDATED event needs to happen on a notified
	file in order to consider the writeback task finished.

	libtracker-miner: Move writeback task removal to UPDATE monitor events
	The last monitor event that's bound to happen from a writeback is a
	UPDATED event caused by:

	UPDATED(a) + MOVE(a->b) = MOVE(a->b) + UPDATED(b), caused by the delay
	in handling the UPDATED so they're merged together. So don't remove
	writeback tasks until we've gotten an update event for that file.

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't set no longer existing property on TrackerMinerApplications
	TrackerMinerFS::processing-pool-requests-limit no longer exists.

	libtracker-miner: make tracker_miner_fs_check_file() use high priority
	This will boost the file to be inspected most promptly, which is usually
	the desired effect of this call, as it's exposed by the IndexFile dbus
	method in tracker-miner-fs.

	libtracker-miner: Add priorities to the sparql buffer
	If a task is of priority G_PRIORITY_HIGH, it will issue an Update()
	instead of a UpdateArray(), so updates are most immediate.

	libtracker-miner: propagate priority throughout file insertions/updates in TrackerMinerFS

	libtracker-miner: Avoid triggering too often the ensure_mtime_cache() hack
	The hack introduced in commit 22087297 is meant to cope with the "delete
	folder and move another on top" situation, forcing reindex if the operation
	was in the middle of being processed. This situation is most relevant for
	monitor events, as deletes can take quite some time to happen recursively.

	However, on unclean shutdowns, this condition also happens often. Even if
	the directory is already indexed in the store, it is pushed for mtime
	check into the queues, which looks exactly the same to ensure_mtime_check().
	The final effect was that plenty of files were being reindexed for the sake
	of it.

	libtracker-miner: Ensure harder process_stop() is only called once
	QUEUE_WAIT is now used more extensively, meaning item_queue_handlers_cb()
	onky gets QUEUE_NONE if there really is nothing left to process, be it
	items in the task pool, pending to be crawled, or in the processing queues.

	libtracker-miner: slightly improve IRI cache performance
	For most cases, fs->priv->current_iri_cache_parent_urn has the
	parent folder URN, so just use it in the query when filling in
	 the IRI cache.

	libtracker-miner: Ensure prioritized tasks always have parents indexed first
	We now check before item_add_or_update() for those files that have a parent
	that should have been indexed, but actually isn't.

	In that case, the file is inserted back to the queue, prepended by its
	parent to ensure it is indexed, if the file meeting these conditions is
	deep in the hierarchy, the parent file will be treated the same, so
	the operation will unroll until an indexed/root directory is found.

	libtracker-miner: Remove TrackerProcessingPool
	It is now unused in favor of TrackerTaskPool/TrackerSparqlBuffer

	libtracker-miner: Use TrackerSparqlBuffer for metadata insertions
	As a side effect, the TrackerMinerFS::processing-pool-requests-limit property
	has been removed, as flow control has been simplified to not needing this third
	queue.

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerSparqlBuffer
	This object inherits from TrackerTaskPool, and takes care of
	dispatching tasks containing SPARQL updates.

	It is meant to replace the sparql buffers in TrackerProcessingPool,
	and in fact inherits much code from there, the main difference being
	that there is no "processing" queue for already packed up batches,
	instead it relies on linear processing of updates.

	That last queue was sheldomly used (if at all), as it requires a
	choking tracker-store that can't insert stuff at the same pace
	that miner-fs processes it, this situation looks quite unlikely,
	and makes the code simpler.

	tracker-miner-fs: Use TrackerTaskPool for the extraction pool

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerTaskPool
	This is a simple task pool implementation, where an external
	entity has to do task pushing/popping.

	Eventually, the TrackerProcessingPool object will be split
	into two of these objects, one for the wait queue, and
	another for the ready/processing queues.

	tracker-miner-fs: Add tracker_miner_fs_check_*_with_priority()
	These functions allow scheduling tasks at a different priority.

	tracker-miner-fs: Add priority argument to tracker_miner_fs_directory_add_internal()

	libtracker-miner: remove TRACKER_QUEUE_PRIORITY* in favor of G_PRIORITY*
	No need to reinvent the wheel

	tracker-miner-fs: Use priority queues for created/deleted/updated/moved items
	At the moment each of these still has its own queue, items are usually added
	with DEFAULT/LOW priority at the moment.

	libtracker-miner: Add tracker_priority_queue_get_length

	libtracker-miner: Make tracker_priority_queue_foreach_remove return gboolean
	it will return TRUE if some item has been removed, FALSE otherwise

	tracker-miner-fs: remove duplicated code
	tracker_miner_fs_has_items_to_process() may just be called there

	tracker-miner-fs: Put CrawledDirectoryData into a priority queue

	tracker-miner-fs: Use a priority queue for directories to be inspected.
	This allows for prioritization of directories, the crawler is never
	stopped in the middle of processing, so if a higher priority directory
	arrives than the one currently processed, it still gets to wait
	as a good boy.

	libtracker-miner: Add TrackerPriorityQueue
	This is a simple type that allows insertion of elements with
	priorities, so doing pop() returns the highest/earliest element
	in the queue.

	tracker-miner-fs: Ensure datasource is also set on error
	This is so files that trigger an extractor error within a removable
	volume gets correctly associated to it.

	libtracker-extract: Remove traces of debugging g_print()s

	tracker-extract: disable again threading traces

	tracker-extract: Use TrackerExtractInfo from libtracker-extract
	Asynchronous tasks in both tracker-extract internals and tracker-extract-client
	actually hold the same information, but each being at one side of D-Bus, so
	make both use the same TrackerExtractInfo data type.

	libtracker-miner: Use tracker_processing_task_unref() instead of _free() to fix build

2011-07-13  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Use API to iterate through extract modules
	This API is always used on the main thread, if some module
	(whatever the thread policy it has) can't handle a file, the
	task is put back in the main thread so the next module is
	called.

	libtracker-extract: Add API to iterate through the modules handling a mimetype
	There are situations where the most specific miner could just not know
	enough about the file, this API allows falling back to less specific
	modules.

	tracker-extract: Rework stats reporting and task cancellation
	Both things share the same threading model, so these are now dealt
	with together.

	tracker-extract: Mark text extractor as thread aware

	tracker-extract: Implement thread awareness for modules
	Tracker extract modules may provide now an init() function, which
	also reports the thread awareness of the given module, allowing
	these to run sequentially in the main thread, on a dedicated thread
	for the extract module, or in a thread pool.

	At the moment no extractor modules do this, so they run by default
	in the main thread as before.

	tracker-miner-fs: Avoid multiple calls to extractor_process_failsafe()
	The accounting of currently processed files has been also improved, all
	to ensure extractor_process_failsafe() is called just once, and tasks
	waiting for process_file_cb() don't sneak in and break failsafe
	extraction.

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't remove item from queue until it's been processed
	Mostly to keep consistency.

	libtracker-extract: Do not use G_CONST_RETURN
	just use const, G_CONST_RETURN doesn't exist in modern glib

	libtracker-extract: Document tracker-client API

2011-07-13  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	tracker-extract: Implement watchdog for stale tasks.
	This forces extraction exit if some task takes more than 20 seconds
	to be finished.

	tracker-miner-fs: Implement failsafe metadata extraction
	This method is independent of how the extractor works, unlike the
	previous method. Now on a extractor failure, the miner does:

	1) Pause itself
	2) Wait for all pending extractor requests to finish
	3) Accumulate all failed extractions on a list
	4) Run through that list items, extracting again one file at a time.
	5) Resume itself

	tracker-miner-fs: Move "retry on extraction failed" code to TrackerMinerFiles
	Currently the simplest approach of retrying just once
	every failed file is taken, after that, the sparql without
	embedded metadata is added.

	libtracker-extract: Add tracker-extract-client API
	This API is meant to replace the code in TrackerMinerFiles to
	deal with the communication with the extractor.

	tracker-miner-fs: Revert commit 3dd75bacc30
	Minimal sparql insertion is going to be handled from
	TrackerMinerFiles instead.

	tracker-monitor: translate CREATE(a)+MOVE(a->b)=UPDATE(b)
	Fixes NB#251032. Tracker-writeback often creates a temporary hidden
	file that, after modification, is moved onto the original file location,
	This tricked TrackerMonitor so that the create and move operations there
	were translated as a create operation, and create operations are
	compressed with delete events into a noop. So if a quick delete came
	after, TrackerMonitor was emitting no signal for a truly deleted file.

	Instead, translate create+move as update, the miners handle creates
	and updates equally, and these won't get compressed with delete
	events, so those are still emitted.

	tracker-extract: _exit() abruptly if cancelled due to pre-unmount
	g_main_loop_quit() docs say it could wait for already dispatched sources,
	time consuming extraction tasks in this case. Given that in pre-unmount
	situation we prefer fast to orderly, just _exit() here.

2011-06-13  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fix inconsistent status with progress signals
	Quite often, we see progress of 100% and still have status messages
	saying Processing... which is not true. So we use an idle timeout to
	help that situation. This happens because miners can use the
	g_object_set() API with multiple properties and we were signalling the
	update between each property being set.

	This commit also enforces setting the status to 'Idle' or
	'Initializing' when the progress is either 1.0 or 0.0

	The output shown in tracker-control is now much cleaner.

	The trace macro was also added to follow state/progress changes along
	with signal emissions more easily.

	libtracker-miner: Make sure "Processing..." is 2% or higher in progress
	Before it was possible to still be 1% (which is usually reserved for
	crawling) while processing the items we have in our queues.

	Also, don't have tigher conditions for when we can issue "Processing..."

	tracker-control: Clean up store progress reporting
	Make it more consistent with the miner reporting.
	Also don't represent 0% with a ✓ (i.e. done)

	tracker-control: Don't represent 0% with a ✓ (i.e. done)

	libtracker-miner: Fixed -0.00 progress being reported
	This occurred because progress of 0.00 was being rounded up from -0.49
	with ceil() and negative 0.00 is given to represented the direction it
	was rounded from.

	This fixes GB#652433, Progress signal gives faulty value just before finishing

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not ignore IgnoreNextUpdate for CREATED events on old files
	Partly fixes #261767. There are two usecases where we could get a CREATED event
	during writeback, one is due to 3rd party apps inserting preliminary sparql
	before actually writing the file, so tracker-miner-fs should index that new
	file anyways.

	The other usecase is on atomic move over an old file, tracker-writeback itself
	would trigger a CREATED event over an already known file, which is safe to
	ignore as it is the result of the just written back metadata.

	writeback: guarantee atomic updates on the file
	We do this by copying the file to a temporary location, modifying
	the temporary file, and moving it onto the original location.

	This generally should be done by the libraries we use in
	tracker-writeback, but we don't get any guarantees that it'll be
	like that...

	It is equivalent to tracker_sparql_connection_get.

	libtracker-sparql-backend: Drop direct_only flag
	As the connection is a singleton, it does not make sense to have a

2011-05-30  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	tracker-extract: plug a few leaks

	tracker-miner-fs: plug a leak

	libtracker-data: plug a leak.

	tracker-miner-fs: Close sparql insert/graph braces on extractor cancellation.
	Fixes NB#258459.

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not spam log on recursive monitors removal
	This part is known to work well, no need to spew a line for each dir

2011-05-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-evolution: When reporting "Updating Folder" state which one
	tracker-control wasn't useful without this since it could be on any folder

	tracker-evolution: Don't set status/progress to twice when Idle

	tracker-evolution: Make miner initable
	This fixes it now showing up on dbus or sending progress updates

	tracker-evolution: Added some debugging to see what's going on

	tracker-evolution: Coding style fixes

	tracker-evolution: Cleaned up unused code and whitespace issues

	tracker-evolution: Renamed object for consistency to MinerEvolution

	tracker-extract: Provide clear logging about which extractor module is used
	This is a bit of a regression, we used to say which extractor module was used
	but we don't for some reason in master. This fixes that.

2011-05-26  Juerg Billeter  <juerg@debian.bitron.ch>

	libtracker-sparql-backend: Work around race condition in GDBus
	GDBusProxy created from a thread without its own GMainContext may cause
	memory corruption due to a race condition in handling the
	NameOwnerChanged signal.

	As we only call a single method on the Status object, drop use of
	GDBusProxy in this case and directly use low level D-Bus support.

	Fixes NB#254855.

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not shutdown cleanly if ctrl+c is hit during initial sleep

2011-05-24  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Fix a crash when destructing QApplication
	Apparently it's not ok to destroy a QApplication which seems to be
	designed for use on the stack of the main() function. This indeed
	leaves a small memory leak at the exit of the process.

	Fixes NB#259000.

2011-05-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't do initial sleep if no mtime check is going to happen
	Crawling will be fairly fast if no mtime checks are to be done (which is the
	most usual case), so avoid initial sleep so we get the monitors in place ASAP.
	Fixes NB#252898.

2011-05-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fix builds including this library using g++

2011-05-23  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-miner: Make tracker_miner_fs_directory_remove() more robust
	the tasks that are likely to perform I/O (extraction, crawling) are
	removed first, so other non-crucial, but time consuming tasks (i.e.
	monitors removal) don't get in the way.

	Also, stuff from priv->crawled_directories is removed, as the miner
	could pick these up for further processing.

	libtracker-miner: Do not perform removed files check if crawling was cancelled.
	Since the logic is "remove from the hashtable all existing files, so the remainder
	can be deleted", there are chances that a file could be left there when crawling is
	interrupted.

	libtracker-miner: Make the failed unmounts watchdog more relaxed
	The timeout priority is now lower so ::mount-unmount has a chance to
	be processed before the watchdog if the miner's main loop is busy
	(say removing monitors). Also, the timeout is longer so we aren't
	overzealous on slow unmounts.

2011-05-19  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tests/libtracker-sparql: Add interleaved connection test
	Based on test by James Thomas.

	libtracker-direct: Support multiple direct connection objects
	If Tracker.Sparql.Connection.get is called after singleton is set to
	null in dispose and before backend object is finalized, multiple direct
	connection objects may exist at the same time.

	The first instance initializes libtracker-data, the last instance shuts
	it down.

	libtracker-bus: Support multiple bus connection objects
	If Tracker.Sparql.Connection.get is called after singleton is set to
	null in dispose and before backend object is finalized, multiple bus
	connection objects may exist at the same time.

	libtracker-sparql-backend: Protect singleton weak pointer with mutex

	libtracker-sparql-backend: Improve debug message for direct connection

2011-05-17  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Do not trigger replay with invalid ontology journal
	Use same criteria as with data journal.

	libtracker-data: Clear ignored journal error in tracker_db_manager_init

	libtracker-data: Use original error code in db_journal_reader_init
	tracker_data_manager_init matches against specific error codes.

	libtracker-data: Move journal reader shutdown out of init_file
	Journal reader shutdown frees journal filename, however, we still want
	to use that in the propagated error message.

	libtracker-data: If unable to writer journal header, delete empty file

	libtracker-data: Use GError for write_all_data in tracker-db-journal

	libtracker-data: Handle EINTR instead of EAGAIN when writing journal
	Writing to a regular file will never set EAGAIN.

	libtracker-data: Remove unneeded out of memory check
	g_realloc never returns NULL (if size > 0). There is no point in trying
	to handle it in a single random place.

	libtracker-data: Small refactoring in error handling of journal writer

	libtracker-data: Use fstat to query size of open journal file
	This avoids querying the size of the wrong file in the unlikely case
	that another process replaced the journal file between open and stat.

	libtracker-data: Propagate errors for ontology transactions

2011-05-16  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-store: Improve Data.Manager.init error handling
	The only noticeable difference is that exit code was 0 when journal
	error was encountered during initialization.

	Updated French translation

2011-05-13  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-miner: Don't crash if TrackerMonitor can't create a sample monitor
	Neither G_OBJECT_TYPE() or g_type_name() can handle NULL, leading to a crash,
	now a critical warning is issued instead.

	libtracker-miner: perform task merging for monitor events
	This only kicks in after initial crawling, and makes most sense
	in paused miners, so consecutive, longer term monitor events
	are merged together with previous unhandled events to avoid
	useless operations after resuming.

2011-05-13  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	functional-tests: Update miner progress signal handler
	D-Bus API was changed by commit f96b30b8.

	hyphens.

2011-05-11  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-store: Stop signal timeout for sequential batch updates
	If tracker-store receives a batch request after processing all previous
	batch requests but before the signal timeout expires, stop the signal
	timeout. This reduces the number of signals sent for batch updates where
	requests do not trigger any queueing in tracker-store, e.g., when
	sending simple batch update every 0.5 s.

	Fixes NB#254154.

	tracker-store: Use Timeout.add instead of add_seconds for signal timeout
	Second granularity is not precise enough for delays that might be
	visible in the user interface.

	tracker-store: Stop signal timeout after an immediate emission

	tracker-store: Always stop signal timeout after handling it
	If a later commit needs the timeout, it will be enabled again in
	on_statements_committed.

	tracker-extract-mp3: Add simple frame tracing to ID3v2.2 and ID3v2.3

2011-05-11  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-miner: Add watchdog for failed unmounts
	Fixes NB#248873. If, for whatever reason, an unmount operation fails
	or doesn't respond in a timely fashion, TrackerStorage will emit
	::mount-point-added again so Tracker keeps monitoring any further
	change in there.

	tracker-needle: Fix crash when showing stats
	GtkDialog's content area is a GtkBox in 3.0, not a GtkVBox

	tracker-needle: check cancellable after all yielded operations
	This avoids corruptions in the model if the cancellable is cancelled
	in the right moment, this could be triggered often by switching views.

	tracker-needle: Make the taglist use Gtk.CellRendererText

	nautilus: Update extension to compile with GTK+3

	tracker-store: Do not export internal methods via D-Bus

2011-05-03  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-control: Disable default dbus timeout on backup/restore
	It's quite likely backup or restore may take > 25 seconds which is the
	default timeout for dbus calls. This was causing errors when there was
	no real timeout issue.

	tracker-control: Allow backup/restore to take local file names
	This will now convert the arguments given into a real URI because a
	URI is expected in tracker-store.

	tracker-miner-rss: Remove check for our update in GraphUpdated
	Before we used GraphUpdated signals and filtered out our updates for
	mfo:updatedTime, this could lead to updates being missed on some graphs.

	This has been removed now and just does one more round to check all feeds
	are up to date instead.

	tracker-miner-rss: Only change mfo:updatedTime if a feed is added
	Also used proper GCancellable for all SPARQL calls

	tracker-miner-rss: Rename functions to make more sense

2011-04-11  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-miner: Fix mtime check
	Due to a bug in the query used for mtime checking, all files were
	considered updated and hence reextracted.

	Fixes NB#241302.

2011-04-11  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-data: Add check for eof at end of ASK queries

	libtracker-data: Error when OFFSET, LIMIT, etc are used with ASK

	libtracker-data: Use "true" in the unit test too, for ASK

	libtracker-data: Make ASK use the same 'true' and 'false' as xsd:boolean
	Fixes NB#245589.

	tracker-store: plug a leak.

	libtracker-extract: Plug a leak

	tracker-extract: Add controller thread
	This thread takes care of DBus dispatching and extractor lifetime
	control, the main thread still carries out metadata extraction in
	a synchronous manner.

2011-04-08  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Protect tracker_db_cursor_get_* with mutex
	This is necessary for parallel queries with direct access.

	Fixes GB#642883.
	Fixes NB#244556.

	tracker-store: Increase maximum signal size from 1000 to 50000 triples
	1000 triples is reached very quickly, especially with signals pending
	for multiple classes. 50000 triples should still not require more than
	1 MB of memory for signals at any time.

	build: Fix build from tarball in libtracker-sparql

2011-04-07  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

2011-04-07  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	miner-fs: Consider "paused by missing store" non critical for mtime check in future runs
	Fixes Bug 644455 - ~/.cache/tracker/no-need-mtime-check.txt is not written if
	tracker-store is stopped before tracker-miner-fs, reported by Michael Biebl.

	Now tracker-miner-fs will consider a safe shutdown if the only pause reason is
	tracker-store missing.

	Fixes GB#644997

2011-04-07  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-extract: Fixed typo breaking distcheck, s/typelibs/typelib/g

	build: Fixed broken distcheck configure arguments
	Evolution plugin was building which shouldn't be the case

	build: Fixed remaining distcheck issues with introspection
	Mostly this is about $top_srcdir vs $top_builddir for Vala vs C files

	build: Require Vala >= 0.12.0, to avoid introspection sed scripting/fixing
	This also fixes a distcheck issue which was quite nasty to try to fix.

2011-04-07  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	Update .gitignore

2011-04-07  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-common: Remove all pop_thread_default occurrences

2011-04-07  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-common: Do not push thread-default context in gconfdbus
	We cannot always push the global default context as a thread-default
	context. The previous commit makes sure that the thread-default context
	is always set to the global default context.

	libtracker-sparql: Use separate thread for sync init if necessary
	tracker_locale_init must run with the thread-default context set to the
	global default context. As pushing a new thread-default context
	requires the current thread to be the owner of the passed context, we
	cannot always push the global default context as a thread-default
	context.

	This commit uses a threadpool job in the case that sync initialization
	is requestesd with the thread-default context not set to the global
	default context.

2011-04-07  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	extract: Plug huge leak
	Every GDBusMethodInvocation in handle_method_get_metadata_fast() was
	being leaked, since that function is handling the replies itself.

2011-04-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	tracker-extract: Also find small albumart, however only as secondary choice
	Fixes NB#242253.

2011-04-06  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	build: Fixed the disparities between gir_DATA and girdir
	Some copy/paste errors not helping with distcheck

	libtracker-sparql: Added TRACKER_CHECK_VERSION and tracker_check_version()
	Now, libtracker-sparql includes tracker-version.h and tracker-sparql.h is a
	real non-generated header which includews the generated vala headers.

	We need to wrap the generated headers from valac to include checks ensuring
	the generated header is not included directly, but rather the on header
	for the entire library is included instead (tracker-sparql.h)

	So now we have -generated-no-checks.h from valac, and all -generated-no-checks.h
	files get converted to -generated.h with the pre-processor additions inserted

	Fixes GB#646365, Add macro to check Tracker version

2011-04-06  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-miner: Do not ignore DELETED event for IgnoreNextUpdate
	We should never see DELETED on update (atomic rename or in-place
	update) but we may see DELETED due to actual file deletion right
	after update.

	Fixes NB#229461.

2011-04-06  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-common: A warning is sufficient here, no need for critical

2011-04-05  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-sparql: Ensure Builder.length is not 0 when not empty
	This caused preupdate fragments from extractors to be dropped in
	certain situations.

	Fixes NB#237582.

	tracker-extract-pdf: Fix SPARQL preupdate for location information

2011-04-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-common: Make sure the first_time trick survives locale_shutdown

	tracker-extract: Use init and shutdown for tracker-locale

	libtracker-common: Device uses system bus, not session bus

	libtracker-common: Locale values must be there on return of the init function

	libtracker-common: Use 2011 for copyright of new files

	libtracker-common: Ensure that the default mainloop is used for the DBus connection

	libtracker-common: Remove false comments about mainloop

	libtracker-common: Use warning instead of message

	libtracker-common: Replace error code with enum

	libtracker-common: Use variable names that are easier to evaluate

	libtracker-common, -data: Don't reinit locale at each locale change

	libtracker-common, -data: Use locale_init and locale_shutdown

	libtracker-common: Cleanly and silently handle non gconf-dbus situation

	libtracker-common: Listen for changes on GConf using DBus directly for meegotouch locales
	Fixes NB#240272.

	libtracker-common: Read meegotouch locales from GConf over DBus directly
	Fixes NB#240272.

	libtracker-sparql: Remove GConf dependency
	In Maemo's case we're now reading from gconf-dbus using GDBus
	directly, instead of using the non-thread-safe gconfclient API

	libtracker-common: Remove reading meegotouch locale config over GConf

2011-04-05  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

2011-04-05  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-miner: Add introspection annotation to docs.

	libtracker-extract: run introspection with --warn-all

2011-04-05  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	libtracker-sparql: Another sed trick to fix vala GIR
	Add scope="true" to all the async function descriptions.

	libtracker-miner: No need for different .gir for TrackerCrawler
	All TrackerMiner definitions can go in TrackerMiner .gir

	libtracker-miner, libtracker-sparql: Added introspection examples
	Miner and Async query are not working as expected yet, but the code
	should be correct.

	libtracker-extract: Depend on Tracker-0.10.gir
	Do not depend in the old TrackerSparql gir.

	build: Require g-ir 0.9.5 or higher
	Vala generates .gir with repository version="1.2" .

	Quoting gobject-introspection changelog:
	Update to version 0.9.5: Major rewrite, that leads to a bump in the gir format (version 1.2).

	libtracker-sparql: Dirty 'sed' only when really needed
	If vala is recent enough, the "sed" operation is not needed.
	Also, run the sed trick only once on the file.

	Vala version is checked via new m4 function.

	Removed the .gir from the CLEANFILES. It must be cleaned only when
	the library it comes from is cleaned.

	libtracker-miner: Add (transfer x) annotation to some methods
	g-ir-scanner was warning the lack of those annotations

	libtracker-miner: Generate 2 gir to fix namespaces
	Due problems with namespaces, now TrackerMiner classes are described in one gir
	(TrackerMiner) and the Crawler in another (TrackerCrawler).

	Reorganized the source files in different variables. Internal files, not
	intended to be exposed in GI under private_sources.

	libtracker-sparql: Set correct library in gir
	This is needed when linked from other gir files.

	libtracker-sparql: Use valac to generate the .gir file. Fix Namespace.
	Use valac --gir instead of g-ir-scanner to generate the .gir file.
	Nested namespaces are not supported: use Tracker instead of TrackerSparql for this.
	Set introspection="0" to a function using va_list. This is a workaround for a bug
	in vala. Remove in the next vala upgrade.

	libtracker-sparql: Use static linking instead of plugins
	Plugin loading in threads may be problematic in certain environments.
	As we do not currently support external plugins anyway, this changes
	libtracker-bus and libtracker-direct to be part of libtracker-sparql.
	This will also slightly improve initialization performance.

2011-03-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	tracker-miner-fs: avoid roundtrips to the extractor
	The miner now queries the extractor module manager whether a
	file is actually handled by the extractors before sending it
	over.

	tracker-extract: Add rule files for the extractors
	The final effect of these rules should resemble the specific vs
	generic approach previously used in the extractor.

	tracker-extract: mass change extractors
	The API has changed, now the following function must be exported:

	gboolean tracker_extract_get_metadata (const gchar          *uri,
	                                       const gchar          *mimetype,
	                                       TrackerSparqlBuilder *preupdate,
	                                       TrackerSparqlBuilder *metadata);

	This was done in one go as there's no painless way to do this...

2011-03-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-extract: Add extractor modules manager.
	This manager parses a directory of keyfiles, describing rules
	for matches, the modules aren't preloaded on initialization,
	instead they are loaded lazily as needed.

	This supersedes the module loading within
	src/tracker-extract/tracker-extract.c, and will be used
	as a replacement in following commits. The specific/generic
	matching there can be replaced by rules at different priorities
	calling the same module.

	because it does not tell us whether a device can be disconnected from
	the system but rather if a device contains a media that might be
	extracted from it. In fact, this method maps the removable flag from
	the kernel block device subsystem.

	If we rely on g_drive_is_media_removable(), most of the USB harddrives
	are considered as non removable, and are therefor won't be indexed.

	This patch proposes to check whether or not the mount point is part of
	the system, and if it's not, we use g_volume_can_mount() method to
	check whether the filesystem can be mounted which gives us a better
	clue about whether the related device is removable or not (in the way
	tracker considers a device from being removable).

	Instead of each resource having its own unique modification-
	sequence number, the modification sequences are defined per
	committed transaction that had properties that aren't transient.

	This commit also changes the fact that a transaction with only
	transient properties was still adding an empty transaction to
	the journal. With that the modification sequence wouldn't
	restore correctly to original state. It wasn't needed, so this
	change removes the empty transaction in the journal in that

2011-01-28  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	tracker-writeback: Add nfo:FileDataObject to tracker-writeback query
	This blocks tracker-writeback from trying to writeback to so-called
	virtual files (resources that are being filled in for a file that
	will arrive as a file in nearby future).

	It does this by requiring nfo:FileDataObject: so-called virtual files
	must not be made nfo:FileDataObject but only nfo:DataObject, as it'll
	be tracker-miner-fs picking up and filling in the nfo:FileDataObject
	parts. As soon as this has happened, tracker-writeback is permitted
	to start becoming responsible for writing metadata back into the file.

	Fixes NB#222494.

	However, this bug illustrates other problems that must be fixed too.

	when the writeback service is enabled, as that would mean that the
	writeback service could writeback heuristicly guessed values.

	back isn't set to the miner-fs's GRAPH.

2010-12-17  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: don't use g_return_val_if_fail() in private methods

	libtracker-miner: set pool owner only if traces enabled

	libtracker-miner: When deleting resources, first mark unavailable and then fully remove them

	libtracker-miner: Improve traces in processing pool, report tasks in timeout

	libtracker-miner: make sure original monitors are removed during a move operation

	libtracker-miner: Ensure proper task queues when crawling
	 If a directory is being crawled (as for example when renaming a directory
	 from an ignored name to a non-ignored one), ensure that items found during
	 crawling are processed only after any other task on the same paths has
	 finished (as for example when we're deleting a whole directory and all its
	 contents, which take a lot of time).

	 To test this, prepare a directory with tons of files inside which is
	 monitored by tracker (named 'not-hidden' for example), and then:
	    1. $> mv not-hidden .hidden
	    2. wait some seconds (previous action should still be processing in the store)
	    3. $> mv .hidden not-hidden
	    4. The addition of all items found during the crawling of 'not-hidden'
	       should wait until the action in step 1 is finished in the store.

	 Before this patch, for each directory found during crawling we were calling
	 item_query_exists() and that was returning TRUE even if it was currently
	 being processed to be removed. Also, before this patch, ensuring the mtime
	 cache was done querying the store, which was returning items even if they
	 were also currently being processed to be removed.

	libtracker-common: New tracker_file_cmp() which returns 0 if files are equal

	libtracker-miner: Improve traces in the processing pool, reason of flush added

	libtracker-monitor: On directory remove, first remove monitors, then notify event

	libtracker-miner: When a moved dir event detected, cancel all monitors in the dir

	libtracker-miner: Don't add monitors when renaming a directory to a hidden name

	build: Disable functional tests by default

	Merge branch 'guarantee'

	libtracker-extract: Rename *from_filename* to *from_file*
	For the Guarantee API

	build: Add a note about support for guaranteed metadata

	libtracker-extract: Update API to allow one function call from extractors
	The idea here is that we don't do the NULL checks, etc everywhere, but
	instead we pass a value in and the uri so we can retrieve the data and
	guarantee a value *if* it wasn't in the value passed in in the first
	place.

	libtracker-extract: Added -guarantee module
	This is designed to use an existing value or guarantee a value from
	the file in some way (in most cases).

	For now this module just does the guessing, next will come the
	checking existing values

	tracker-needle: Use cursor.next_async() to give Spinner some cpu time
	This currently causes a crash, this has been committed to allow testing
	against the issues which resides in libtracker-fts due to libtracker-fts
	expecting a single threaded use

	tracker-needle: Added a spinner to indicate when searching
	Using while(yield cursor.next()) {} seems to cause a crash here
	so currently operations are not totally async so the spinner isn't
	seen unless left running and shown

	tracker-needle: Added tracker-view.vala to handle different result set views

	tracker-needle: Don't show find-in buttons where unused

	tracker-needle: Fixed music query to include title/artist/albums

	Ontology: Neo: Remove neo:heuristic-activity
	heuristic-activity is too ill defined at this stage. Needs more consideration,
	so removing for now.

	Ontology: Neo: Removed neo:Relation
	This too generic and ill defined at this point. Even if it proves useful in
	the future, it should be in a seperate ontology.

	Ontology: Neo: Rename zg to NEO
	After discussions, it was decided that we will need a generic event onology, so
	rename Zg (zeitgeist) to NEO - New (Nepopuk to be) Event Onotlogy.

	Ontology: Neo: Update lastModified

	Ontology: Neo: Fixed syntax issues and typos

	Ontology: Neo: Removed eventId from Event and some other small changes
	Remove eventId from Event.

	Ontology: Neo: hasEventInterpretation now sub-property of nie:interpretedAs
	hasEventInterpretation should not be a sub property of nie:interpretedAs as an event is not a nie:DataObject.
	Subjects of events should be InformationElements rather than any old resource.

	Ontology: Neo: Add zeitgeist's ontology
	I've transformed Zeitgeits's zg ontology form trig to turtle and fixed it up so it works with tracker.

	libtracker-miner: Use tracker prefix in the processing pool

	libtracker-miner: simplify array creation as we know the size in advance

	libtracker-miner: Split internal PROCESS queue into two: READY and PROCESSING
	 * When having a single queue for items in the SPARQL buffer and items being
	   pushed to the store; as the limit of the queue was a single one, we were
	   actually having an undesired behaviour: While an array-update of 100 items
	   was being done, every new task pushed to the processing pool was not
	   buffered, as the limit of the queue was reached.

	 * So now, the READY queue holds the tasks being buffered, and the PROCESSING
	   queue holds the items currently being pushed to the store.

	tracker-miner-fs: Max 10 files extracting, and 100 files processing

	libtracker-miner: When QUEUE_WAIT, force a processing pool buffer flush

	  This means that we must not get an UPDATED event when we just create

2010-09-14  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-sparql: Added comprehensive test for cursor_next()
	Basically, added cursor_next_async() + cancellable_cancel() + new
	query to make sure things work properly in those cases.

	Also use queries which actually exist for most people (based on
	the ontology). Queries 4 and 5 are there for historical reasons, these
	are what showed the situation in the first place.

	libtracker-data: Don't set async wrapper callback func to NULL after calling it
	If the callback that's called actually calls the cursor_next_async()
	then the callback is set to NULL after it is initially set and so no
	results are reported for n>1 items.

	Fixes NB#187558: libtracker-miner, try to fix nfo:FileDataObjects without nfo:belongsToContainer
	 * Note: every time a given item is not found in the IRI cache, an additional query
	   is done to the resource to check if there is already an item with the same
	   nie:url. This may happen for application-created nfo:FileDataObjects: when they
	   are created after the miner-fs have updated its cache, or directly when the new
	   ones do not have a proper nfo:belongsToContainer.

	 * The new query will be done in two cases: when new files are created and the
	   miner-fs received a CREATED/UPDATED event; and also during initial crawling (to
	   handle new nfo:FileDataObjects created while the miner-fs was not working). Note
	   that this additional queries during initial crawling do not affect much the
	   crawling performance (couldn't really find any degradation).

	tracker-writeback: Fix cursor leak

2010-09-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	libtracker-miner: Fixed GRAPH in IgnoreNextUpdate case

	tracker-store: writeback: Do the transaction trick for Writeback too

	tracker-store: class-signal: At on_committed the values aren't there yet for libtracker-sparql clients
	Not fully fixed, needs more investigation

	tracker-store, libtracker-data: Workaround for graph not being used in SPARQL DELETE
	Because GRAPH is kept NULL for tracker-data-update.c during a SPARQL DELETE with a
	graph wasn't the writeback functionality being done correctly: only for the
	default graph must the writeback signal emit. But with graph always being NULL for
	deletes, would it always emit for any delete.

	And the IgnoreNextUpdate SPARQL query of tracker-miner-fs does a DELETE in a graph,
	meaning that this triggers tracker-store into doing a new writeback emit, and makes
	tracker-writeback writeback again, and that makes miner-fs do a new IgnoreNextUpdate,
	until the end of times (endless loop between store, writeback and miner-fs)

	tracker-writeback: Fixed compilation errors

	functional-tests: class-signal: Add performance test

	Flickr miner: port writeback to new signal
	This commit adapts the Flickr miner so that it now follows the new
	writeback signal, which sends integers insteads of URIs.

2010-09-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	functional-tests: class-signal: Removed unused variable

	examples: class-signal: Remove unneeded code

	examples: class-signal: Add example in plain C

	tracker-store, tracker-writeback: Changed the subject of Writeback signal to int
	This reduces D-Bus traffic for an internal API (the Writeback signal) and allows
	us to have to store less memory in tracker-store.

	libtracker-data: Add support for tracker:subject() to SPARQL engine

	tracker-store, tracker-writeback: Changed the Writeback signal to use IDs
	The rdf_types array used to be an array of class URI strings. With the
	support for tracker:id() can tracker-writeback (over libtracker-sparql)
	also receive the IDs of the classes, and then query for it.

	tracker-writeback: Fixes after Martyn's review

	tracker-writeback: Fix memory leak in XMP writeback module

	tracker-writeback: Fix memory leak in taglib writeback module

	tracker-writeback: Port tracker-writeback to libtracker-sparql

	NB#184505 - Video files without audio are listed as music clips.
	Do not extract the album tag if the file is not an audio file, the ontology

	Do not take !cursor as no results, rather !tracker_sparql_cursor_next().
	Also, ensure error is cleared before possibly reusing it in the next
	iteration.

	tracker-tag: bail out if none of the passed files exist in the store.

	NB187148 - "Not tagged, file is not indexed" message is seen when adding a tag

	libtracker-miner: Allow API to bypass checks for users
	This allows the user to say, index /foo/bar and it doesn't need to be
	related to the config. This means that if it is outside the configured
	directories then it must be maintained by the application calling the
	API.

	tracker-control: Make -f and -m outputs translatable
	Also use g_printerr() for error situations

	tracker-control: Print when reindexing mime types or files is successful

	TrackerMinerManager: Add GError infrastructure.

	TrackerMinerManager: Make index_file() return boolean.

	Make the IndexFile DBus method handle directories.

	Add tracker_miner_fs_check_directory().
	This function differs with tracker_miner_fs_directory_add() in that
	the directory is not added to priv->config_directories, and the dir
	is only inspected if it's part of one of the configured directories.

	Rename tracker_miner_fs_file_add() to check_file().

	Rename IndexFiles DBus method to IndexFile
	A single parameter is passed, so plural doesn't make sense here.

	tracker-control: Add --index-file parameter.

	TrackerMinerManager: Add method to invoke tracker-miner-fs to index a file.

	Fixes: GB#613252, Application-driven indexing and metadata storage
	Add DBus method to request a file to be indexed.

	Make tracker_miner_fs_file_add() take a check_parents arg.

	Renamed TrackerMinerFilesReindex to TrackerMinerFilesIndex.
	It will be gaining new methods where "reindex" don't have much sense.

2010-07-19  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-common: Fix memory leak when receiving partial reply plus error in DBus sync call
	 * So, we're using g_memory_output_stream_new () with a NULL destroy_function.
	   This means we take ownership and control of the internal buffer if the
	   GOutputStream. Then, if the SYNC DBus query results in an error, we won't
	   pass the stream->data to upper layers, so we need to explicitly free it,
	   or a memleak will happen.

	 * Same issue as in commit 2891b982414900a0844265ea831df83c9dfc9895, but for
	   SYNC method this time.

	libtracker-common: Better call stream_get_data() after dbus_pending_call_block()
	 * Just in case, to avoid crash if realloc() happens with stream->data.

	libtracker-common: Fix memory leak when receiving partial reply plus error in DBus async call
	 * So, we're using g_memory_output_stream_new () with a NULL destroy_function.

	libtracker-miner: minor style fixes

	libtracker-miner, miner-fs: Avoid querying with fn:starts-with if not needed
	  * So, if miner-fs knows that it created one of the dummy nfo:Folders without
	  a specific parent (when initializing mounts), it will notify about that
	  created nfo:Folder to the underlying TrackerMinerFS, so that it takes it into
	  account when regenerating mtime and IRI caches. This avoids querying the store
	  with fn:starts-with for all empty folders, so that query is only done if the
	  parent in the query is exactly one of the parents of the previously created
	  directories without parent.

	  * For example, if we got a mount in /home/user/whatever, we need to create the
	  nfo:Folder of that /home/user/whatever before creating the tracker:Volume. When
	  we do so, we do not set the proper parent (nfo:belongsToContainer) in the newly
	  created nfo:Folder, because we still don't know it. But in this case we will
	  tell the TrackerMinerFS that we got a new directory without parent. MinerFS will
	  store the parent of this directory without parent, /home/user in this case; so
	  that when regenerating caches, if first query using nfo:belongsToContainer yields
	  no results; and if the uri used in nfo:belongsToContainer corresponds exactly to
	  one of the GFiles we stored in the internal list, then we do a second query
	  using the given uri (/home/user) as filter in fn:starts-with. This will avoid
	  duplicates in the store for the /home/user/whatever folder, as we properly
	  populated the IRI cache.

	Fixes GB#624346, libtracker-miner: Proper tracker:mountPoint set for volumes
	  * Before creating a tracker:Volume, we will first check that the specified
	    tracker:mountPoint exists in the store. If it does not exist, we will
	    create a dummy nfo:Folder for that mount point. But, in order to get it
	    populated with the proper information when crawling it, we need to hack
	    the mtime and iri caches, so that if cache is empty after querying the
	    store with nfo:belongsToContainer; we do a second query using a FILTER
	    with fn:start-with(uri). The dummy nfo:Folder we're inserting won't have
	    initially the proper nfo:belongsToContainer property, that's why we need
	    this hack.

	tracker-miner-fs: Unix time origin not good as dummy time...
	  ... because the directories where removable media is mounted, may actually
	  have mtime=0. So better use a random mtime value in the past.

	tracker-miner-fs: Create dummy nfo:Folder for mountpoint if needed

	tracker-miner-files: Make initial volume query synchronous, and check if mount point exists in store

	libtracker-miner: New tracker_miner_execute_sparql_sync() API method

	libtracker-db: Support for moving rotated chunks to another location

	libtracker-data, libtracker-db: Reimplement Backup() and Restore() to use tar
	The original implementation of Backup() and Restore() used a simple file copy
	of the journal. When we have rotated journals we of course can't use only the
	active journal for Backup(). And for Restore() we want to put the rotation state
	back the way it was when the backup was made too. So the best option I could
	come up with was to use a simple tar.

	libtracker-data: Altering the tables for domain-specific indices

	libtracker-data: Added tracker:domainIndex property
	In this commit the tracker:domainIndex property has no function yet. It'll
	be implemented to represent a setting that will make the storage redundantly
	store a property in the table of its domain, in order to allow placing an
	index on the column for that table.

	For example nmm:MusicPiece has a domain-index on nie:title. This will make
	it store a redundent copy of nie:title in nmm:MusicPiece's SQL table,
	while also having a copy in nie:InformationElement's table. The advantage is
	a less complex query and the possibility to set an index on the redundant
	column in nmm:MusicPiece's table.

	Update Czech translation by Marek Cernocky

2010-07-15  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	Fixes GB#624071, t-s-t: Query results is always a 2 dimensional array.
	  * So when query returns no results, 'results' will be not NULL, but
	    results[0] will be NULL. We need to check for this latter case as
	    well before using the results array or we end up reading garbage.

	Fixes NB#179798: Wrong detection of ignored directory as a directory

	Fixes NB#176090, libtracker-miner: Don't use same parent GFile for both mtime and iri caches
	 * If the same GFile parent is used to check if cache corresponds to that given
	   parent GFile, it may happen that while ensuring mtime cache, parent is updated
	   but IRI cache is untouched, so that when a new file is inserted the parent of
	   the IRI cache is no longer the one in the parent GFile. Instead of cleaning
	   both caches when the common parent changes, it seems better to have a specific
	   parent for each one.

	The iterator belongs to libtracker-client

	TrackerResultIterator when passed in callback does belong to the lib,

	libtracker-client: use tracker_dbus_send_and_splice

	FS miner: use the GetMetadataFast of tracker-extract

	tracker-extract: Add a GetMetadataFast method
	The GetMetadataFast method uses DBus FD passing to transfer the
	resulting SPARQL query. The client passes a FD when calling the method,
	and the resulting queries will be written to that FD.

	libtracker-common: Add "send and splice"
	The tracker_dbus_send_and_splice function sends a DBusMessage, splices

	Add tests for Tracker Steroids
	This commit adds test for all the functions introduced in tracker-store
	and libtracker-client to handle the new Steroids interface. Coverage has
	been verified using gcov.

	Add Steroids example client
	This commit adds a steroids-sparql program. This program shows how to
	use the tracker_resources_sparql_query_iterate function to do a query
	and fetch the results. It does exactly the same thing as
	tracker-sparql -q.

	libtracker-client: Add Steroids support
	This commit add several function in libtracker-client to exploit the new
	Steroids interface.

	The main function is tracker_resources_sparql_query_iterate, which will
	return a TrackerResultIterator. This iterator can then be used to
	iterate over the results using the tracker_result_iterator_* functions.
	Note that iteration is not done on DB side, all results are first fetch
	into a buffer on client side. This is because keeping an iterator on
	server side would block access to other clients, SQLite not being MVCC.

	Add Tracker Steroids interface
	The Steroids interface uses a local pipe to transfer query results,
	instead of sending them over DBus. To do so, it uses a new feature in
	DBus 1.3 which allows passing UNIX file descriptors in messages.

	This commit introduces a new DBus object exported on the store at path
	/org/freedesktop/Tracker1/Steroids. Methods are in the interface
	org.freedesktop.Tracker1.Steroids.

	The DBus interface is composed of two methods:
	PrepareQuery <- SPARQL query
	             -> UNIX file descriptors where results will be written
	             -> Query identifier
	The PrepareQuery call initiates a query in Tracker. The query is not
	really prepared, in the sense that a PrepareQuery with an erroneous
	query will succeed. It's the Fetch call which will fail in that case.
	The returned query identifier can be used to initiate the Fetch.

	Fetch        <- Query identifier
	The Fetch call executes the query with the given identifier, and returns
	the results over the pipe returned by PrepareQuery.

	Note that while results are being fetched, a DB cursor is left open,
	blocking other concurrent INSERTs. It is therefore important to fetch
	the results and free the iterator as fast as possible.

	libtracker-miner: New helper macros to work with storage types

	Fixes GB#621108: Update available resources when IndexRemovableMedia or IndexOpticalDiscs changes

2010-06-16  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Fixes NB#174333 - Each file is listed twice in tracker search results
	Unset parent folder so caches are regenerated.

	The issue was due to priv->current_folder being reused for both mtime
	cache (for crawling stage) and iri cache (for indexing stage). So when
	recrawling, the miner changes current_folder without invalidating the
	iri cache, so there could be a mismatch when it enters the indexing
	stage again.

	* If unaccenting requested, all combining diacritical marks

	  mark removal in-place without any extra allocation.

	* libunac dependency is completely removed.

2010-06-01  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Add CrawlingInterval configuration option.
	This either forever enables mtime queries for initial crawling, disables it,
	or specified an interval in days until the next crawling.

	The other use of crawling (setting up monitors) is unavoidable.

2010-06-01  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Fix to the message related generator scripts to use simple contacts for each message instead of linking directly to personContacts.
	Small fix to music pieces to not randomize artists and albums.

2010-06-01  Aleksander Morgado  <aleksander@lanedo.com>

	Fixes GB#619498: Check if stop word before stemming, not after
		* tests/libtracker-fts/tracker-parser-test.c: Added new unit tests
		for stop-words.

		* src/libtracker-common/tracker-language.c
		* docs/manpages/tracker-store.1
		New TRACKER_LANGUAGE_STOP_WORDS_DIR environment variable to specify
		the path where stop words dictionaries are available, used for
		testing.

		* src/libtracker-fts/tracker-parser-glib.c
		* src/libtracker-fts/tracker-parser-libicu.c
		* src/libtracker-fts/tracker-parser-libunistring.c
		Check for stopword is done before the word stemming, if applicable.

	Updated NEWS

	Fixed data/ontologies/Makefile.am, #92 description file was missing

2010-05-27  Tshepang Lekhonkhobe  <tshepang@gmail.com>

	fixes GB#619826 TST: for search & history, don't clean-up search terms
	* TST was trying to be smart by cleaning-up  search terms
	  (removing non-alphanumeric characters) before using them to
	  query as well as before storing them in history.
	* This change allows TST to send the search terms as-is to
	  tracker-store, but as for history, it first strips both leading
	  and trailing whitespace, while also applying normalization.

	tracker-extract: PDF: g_timer_start isn't needed here

	libtracker-extract: Add docs for public API

2010-05-27  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Fixed GB#619801 - We need SPARQL escaping for cases where we use g_file_info_get_display_name()
	This was partially broken by commit b724b6128124f53d8a4053674df7a19ffebe566b

	tracker-search: Don't append "*" to all fts:match queries
	This means that less results will be returned generally, but it also
	means the user has the option to add it when they want instead of
	never be able to remove it.

	tracker-utils: Fixed libtracker-client header includes

	Fixes NB#170915 - tracker-search for snippet is resulting in errors

	libtracker-db: Add interrupt handling to create_result_set_from_stmt

	libtracker-db: Use atomic get_int instead of compare
	Because we reset the flag now, it's not needed to set to 0 after
	the check

	libtracker-db: Use 100 for the progress handler and also check in iter_next

	libtracker-db: Fixed a race condition in interrupt handling

	libtracker-db: Handle interruptable create_statement

	libtracker-db: Don't use the less reliable sqlite3_interrupt
	Use a progress handler instead, which allows more control. Also lock the
	interrupting itself so that no interrupts take place while a statement is
	being prepared.

2010-05-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	libtracker-[db|data]: Improve error checking on SQL calls.
	A new GError parameter was added to tracker_db_interface_create_statement(), all
	callers have been updated to handle errors where it made most sense. Also,
	a bunch of calls to execute_query(), execute(), start_cursor() and iter_next()
	have been changed to also check for errors.

	FTS parser: max_words_to_index in the parser implementation is not needed, so removing it

	FTS parser: delimit_words is always FALSE, so removing it

	Fixes GB#617812: Tracker not disabled when started on battery power
		* FS miner reads battery-related conf and acts based on the configured
		parameters.

		* The first index done is detected based on a new .firstindex stamp
		file created in $cachedir/tracker/ when the FS miner finishes a full
		index (only if the file is not already there). When a re-index is
		forced or database files removed, that file is also removed so that
		the miner detects it and a new first full index is done.

		* Miner-FS is now linked to libtracker-db, so that it can use the new
		API methods to check if the first index was done, and to set the first
		index as done.

	TrackerMinerFS: Fix mtime cache for crawl directories themselves.
	Mtime cache works by querying the parent folder, but for crawl directories
	there wouldn't be any data for its parent folder, needlessly reindexing
	these again, and leaving orphaned urns in the database. This problem would
	add up in consecutive runs, as direct children nfo:belongsToContainer would
	still point to the orphaned node, thus spreading the problem through the
	hierarchy.

	Files renamed as using GIOChannel instead of GInputStream

	Reuse the same code for text and oasis/contents

	re-enable the check for non-NULL pid, as it is really needed

	Allow pid pointer being NULL

	minor alignment fix

	Moved the istream text reader to a separate file

	Fixed text extractor
	 * It was reading up to 1Mbyte, but then only considering the first 65k
	 * Now gets the max bytes to read from config file, not the hardcoded 1Mbyte limit.
	 * Only read up to the max bytes limit

	tracker_text_validate_utf8 can return only the number of valid UTF-8 bytes

	Setup config also for standalone mode

	Fix the tracker-extract config

	Updated man page of tracker-extract.cfg with new max_bytes parameter

	Fixes GB#616845 - Avoid word counting in the extractors
	 * New max_bytes parameter added to tracker-extract config file. Extractors will
	    read up to that configured limit.
	 * Removed the need of reading the FTS config file from tracker-extract.
	 * Word counting not done now in the extractors.

	 Note: As a side-effect, last word extracted when reached max_bytes may get cut
	  and only first chunk of it extracted.

	Turtle files are now processed in the exclusive thread, processing

	updates aren't blocked for an indeterminate time.

	As now only 1 thread is used for database updates, this should

	libtracker-db: Shut down properly thread data on thread destruction.
	At the time a thread is being destroyed, g_thread_self() is no longer reliable,
	nor any g_private_set() calls on further data our interface threads depend on
	(such as FTS).

	So, do not rely on GThread for removing from the interfaces hashtable, and
	attach the FTS data struct directly to the TrackerDBInterface so we can shut
	it down before closing the database (it also likes to do queries, which might
	not be finalized yet)

2010-04-22  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: do sanity check on is_parent() and is_descendant().

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: Check more carefully for is_parent().
	Be more intelligent about trailing slashes and don't take exact string matches as a positive.

	Use tracker:uri-is-descendant() in recursive delete operations.

	TrackerMinerFS: Get rid of slash_uri in queries where we use tracker:uri-is-*()
	This is already handled in these functions, so no need for that check in the miner.

	TrackerMinerFS: Improve condition in ensure_iri_cache().

	Remove \n from g_debug and g_criticals.

	TrackerMinerFS: Make mtime/iri caches query per folder through tracker:uri-is-*().
	Also, the query to get all children on directory moving is done through tracker:uri-is-descendant().

	TrackerSparqlExpression: add tracker:uri-is-parent/descendant() sparql functions.

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: Add functions to deal with URIs hierarchy.
	SparqlUriIsParent and SparqlUriIsDescendant have been added, taking 2 URIs and
	returning true if the second is a direct/indirect child of the former.

	TrackerMinerFS: Cache URNs for the processed files.
	This cache is cleared on processing directory change, late additions are also
	handled, as well as cache invalidation on files being moved/deleted.

	TrackerMinerFS: Do not query parent URN frequently if it doesn't exist.
	This is specially visible in the applications miner, since the container
	directories aren't actually stored.

	TrackerMinerFS: Perform one mtime query per folder.
	Now that crawling/processing order is guaranteed to have all items
	in one folder to be handled together, perform a mtime query per folder,
	and compare against these results.

	 * Reading the string is now done in either 1 or 2 GSF reads, not byte per byte.

	 * Limited the max number of bytes to be read from the stream, to the common safe
	     limit of 3*max_words*max_word_size.
	 * Contents are now normalized and word-counted in a buffered way.

	tracker-preferences: Workaround for gtk+ bug setting scalers to max default
	The scaler type in gtk+ seems to be setting the scaler's value to its max
	default when the scaler is in a tab, the tab isn't open and
	gtk_widget_show_all is called for. It also signals when this happens the
	changed signal. In the signal handler we set the config object. If the tab
	is never activated that means that we've written the config value with some-
	thing the user didn't ask for (the default max value). I workaround-fixed
	this by only setting the config object on apply-click.

	t-s-t: Use GAppInfo to launch default application.

	This is so window size doesn't change with long paths/filenames.

	t-s-t: Have insensitive link buttons when no item is selected.

	Set search entry as mnemonic widget for the label.

	t-s-t: Do not make main window paintable, it's not necessary.

	Make search entry grab focus on Ctrl+S
	Now TrackerEntry implements GtkActivatable, grabbing focus in this case.
	Since there is no GtkAction interfacing, a new GtkAccelGroup has been added
	to the main window to deal with this.

	libtracker-fts: Separate FTS index from virtual table initialization
	As we do not use the virtual table layer for updates, the combined
	initialization of FTS index and virtual table layer causes problems

	table layer is disconnected.

	Revert "tracker-extract: Don't try to spawn odt2txt if it isn't installed"
	A configure check is not sufficient to detect if a binary is installed
	or not as build system != runtime system in the majority of cases.

	A correct fix would be to check for odt2txt at runtime.

	This reverts commit 232e3b0190ae538160162c3d5fd14b346b23323a.

	TrackerMinerFS: Check recursivity in config when crawling dirs.

	Also, now tracker_mine_fs_directory_add_internal() is used in

	these passed by the user.

	libtracker-extract: Improve the documentation and document tracker-utils.[ch]

	Fixed documentation include references

	libtracker-extract: Code clean up
	This involves:

	 - Renaming all tracker_extract_* APIs to tracker_ APIs. We don't do
	   this everywhere and it was completely inconsistent and only for
	   utilities. The structures were not using the same naming either.

	 - Fixed some compiler warnings (for vorbis)

	 - Fixed the includes in libtracker-extract source files. Many were
	   not needed.

	libtracker-extract: Moved exif section docs out of #ifdef

	libtracker-extract: Don't include libtracker-common files in example

	libtracker-extract: Relicense to LGPL from GPL

	libtracker-client: Relicense to LGPL from GPL

	libtracker-client: Added tracker-client.h for central inclusion
	This avoids adding different headers from the same library for 3rd
	parties and is for compatibility with any new changes made. Note that
	the sparql-builder.h is not checked and can be included separately
	still because Vala has no easy way to add #define/#errors.

	libtracker-common: Added check for inclusion outside Tracker again

	tracker-extract: Removed ImageMagick extractor, not used for some time

	tracker-extract: Fixed linking
	Don't link against libtracker-common for extractors which don't use
	libtracker-common APIs directly.

	Also fixed libtracker-extract Makefile because we definitely shouldn't
	be linking with libtracker-common there.

	tracker-extract: Fixed type for force-module option

	tracker-extract: Removed a bunch of unnecessary includes

	tracker-extract: Removed unused defines

	libtracker-extract: Added tracker-extract.h to include other files
	This has been added for compatibility.
	For now, we have removed the TRACKER_ENABLE_INTERNALS check for
	libtracker-common so the extractor modules can be built, but ideally
	those should not need to use libtracker-common.

	tracker-extract: Added --force-module option
	This allows developers to force a particular module is used over all
	the others available.

	libtracker-extract: Added example to examples/libtracker-extract
	Moved mockup from src/tracker-extract/ to here.
	Used MP3 source and added comments to detail what is going on

	This command line paramenter will force the insertion of an specific
	file into the store, by spawning a config-less TrackerMinerFiles and
	feeding it the file directly.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Prepare against missing configuration.

	tracker-extract-playlist: Don't relate list entries through nie:isStoredAs
	nie:MediaFileListEntry isn't supposed to be a nie:DataObject, so the use
	of nie:isStoredAs to relate these with the nfo:MediaList is wrong, plus
	it ends up in sparql errors that prevent the addition of playlists to the
	database.

	Remove too lax check for not monitoring IndexSingleDirectories children, which
	was also affecting legit dirs in IndexRecursiveDirectories which were a child
	of the former.

	TrackerMinerFS should only emit monitor_directory() for directories where both
	check_directory() and check_directory_contents() have returned TRUE, We're
	actually interested in monitoring any directory (and children) in
	IndexRecursiveDirectories where that does happen, and the latter call shouldn't
	happen for children of IndexSingleDirectories, so it's safe to just return TRUE
	there.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Do not trigger multiple rechecks on config file changes.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Listen to changes in IgnoredDirectories[WithContent].
	Any change on these values will force a check on all indexed
	contents, so all monitors are properly added/removed as necessary.

	TrackerMinerFS: Add tracker_miner_fs_force_recheck().
	This new call forces recheck on any directory previously passed through
	tracker_miner_fs_directory_add(). In addition, monitors are now also
	removed during the (re)crawling phase if told by the implementation.

	TrackerMonitor: Only log removals if the dir was monitored.

	TrackerMinerFS: Check both directory/contents before adding a monitor.
	Without this change, monitors would be added on directories excluded
	by the IgnoredDirectoriesWithContent configuration option.

	TrackerMinerFS: Keep added directories around.
	Now data added through tracker_miner_fs_directory_add() is
	kept around, and the crawler is just handed a const reference
	to it.

2010-02-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix typo in debug message.

	Bug #609004 - Timeout on 1 file during extraction causes 10 to fail .
	TrackerMinerFS can process paralelly as many files as the ::process-pool-limit
	property say, but tracker-extract inspects files one by one. So if some file
	takes longer than the extractor timeout, all the other concurrently processed
	files will receive a DBus no reply/timeout as well.

	So, if we get a DBus timeout on any file that's not the first that was added
	to the processing pool, we retry extraction on that file.

2010-02-18  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Ensure ::check-directory is called on root folders.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Use TrackerMinerFS API to get URNs.
	Now both file and parent URNs are taken from TrackerMinerFS if
	any. In the case a file doesn't exist (i.e. doesn't have an URN
	yet) an anonymous URN will be used as usual.

	TrackerMinerFS: Add API to know a file/parent urn.
	This API allows retrieving the URN for a GFile being
	processed (to check for file existence in the store),
	or it's parent's (to set nfo:belongsToContainer
	relationship).

	Since files are guaranteed to be processed together
	with the other files in the same folder, and parent
	folders are guaranteed to be fully processed before
	its children, The method to cache the parent folder
	URN should have little impact on performance.

	In order to retrieve the URN for the file itself,
	a extra call to item_query_exists() had to be added,
	unfortunately, doing so on should_change_index_for_file()
	is not an option, since it happens on the crawling
	phase, so all URNs would have to be stored. This is
	a performance vs memory usage problem.

	TrackerMinerFS: warn if one file has >1 URNs.

	TrackerCrawler: Report a GNode with the file hierarchy.
	TrackerCrawler now provides a GNode with the directory/file
	hierarchy on ::directory-crawled for each GFile passed at
	tracker_crawler_start(), all the stats are also reported
	per directory root. ::finished is now only used to notify
	about interruption.

	TrackerMinerFS now takes a copy of each of the GNodes intead
	of appending directly to items_created. Whenever items_created
	is empty, the stored GNodes are checked for more contents to
	inspect. This is done so TrackerMinerFS guarantees that a
	directory has been already added to the store before processing
	its children.

	Tracker-extract: Do not specify subject in embedded insert.

	TrackerSparqlBuilder: allow embedder to specify the subject.
	Embedded inserts now only consist of predicate/subject, so the
	embedder is able to specify the subject the data is applying to.

	libtracker-common: Port sparql_builder_object_unvalidated to Vala

	NCO: Add IMAddress and adapt existing IM classes and properties
	This commit applies various changes to the ontology for multiple
	reasons. It increases consistency between email addresses, phone
	numbers, and IM addresses. This enables the use of anonymous contacts
	for IM messages. Furthermore, this commit also simplifies queries
	that involve merged contacts, which improves the performance
	significantly. Despite all the changes, full backward compatibility is
	retained during a transition period as this commit does not yet remove
	the deprecated classes and properties.

	The class nco:IMAddress and the property nco:hasIMAddress have been
	added. nco:hasIMAddress can be used by any nco:Contact and represents
	an instant messaging address consisting of nco:imID and nco:imProtocol.
	This improves consistency with how email addresses and phone numbers
	are handled in NCO.

	nco:IMContact has been deprecated in favor of using nco:PersonContact
	with nco:hasIMAddress. This avoids special casing IM contacts.

	The address of a nco:IMAccount is now stored in nco:imAccountAddress,
	this allows to consolidate the nearly duplicate properties such as
	nco:imId and nco:imContactId and the other nco:im* and nco:imContact*
	property pairs. To improve consistency among these properties and ease
	transition, nco:imContactCapability has been renamed to
	nco:imCapability.

	nco:hasIMAccount has been deprecated as it did not provide any
	information as it was only applicable to a single subject,
	nco:default-contact-me.

	nco:fromIMAccount has been deprecated and replaced by nco:hasIMContact,
	which provides the same information in reversed form, that is, it links
	IM accounts of the user to IM contacts (buddy list).

	nco:MetaContact and nco:metaContact have been deprecated in favor of
	storing merged contacts. Contact details can be linked to the data
	source with named graphs in future versions of Tracker. This provides
	vastly simpler and more efficient access to merged contacts.

	libtracker-miner: Removed tracker_miner_fs_get_directories()
	This is no longer needed.

	tracker-miner-fs: Improved feature to update indexed paths in realtime
	This does several things:

	  - Avoids the TrackerConfig for the object notify if the list data
	    hasn't actually changed.
	  - Allow tracker_keyfile_object_load_string_list() to return the list
	    instead of use it with g_object_set().
	  - Don't load defaults into config everytime we reload, only
	    initially.
	  - Directories are removed from list of dirs when indexed, so we now
	    keep a list of config specified directories to index so we have a
	    real list to compare to when the config updates (previously the
	    old list was NULL if indexing was complete leading to a reindex of
	    ALL locations because the list was different).
	  - Don't notify about the index-{recursive|single}-directories twice.
	    This happened because we loaded the config into the GObject and

2010-02-04  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMonitor: Workaround design flaw in libinotify.
	libinotify keeps a hashtable of watch descriptor/handle, and does
	removing in an asyncrhonous manner. So when inotify_add_watch()
	reuses a watch descriptor, removing/adding whithout having
	libinotify process the events coming from the fd may cause the
	wrong handle (the just added one) to be removed.

	TrackerMonitor now adds, and then removes old monitors, when a
	directory is moved, so there's no opportunity to remove the wrong
	handle.

2010-02-04  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-extract-gstreamer: Handle encrypted streams
	Also extract metadata from encrypted streams and set
	nfo:isContentEncrypted to true for these files.

	Fixes NB#152635.

	tracker-extract: Bugfixes for NB#155435 in gstreamer extractor

2010-02-04  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Use property functions instead of OPTIONAL in tracker-search queries.
	This performs quite faster with the current DB backend.

2010-02-04  Aron Xu  <aronxu@gnome.org>

	Update Simplified Chinese translation.

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Free properly all metadata extracted from PDF files.
	both tracker_coalesce() and write_pdf_data() free the used values,
	so only keywords in the XMP case must be freed, since it isn't used.

	Fix compile error in the vorbis extractor.

2010-02-03  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Merge branch 'anonymous-file-nodes'

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Remove unneeded parens.

	tracker-extract: plug leak.

	tracker-extract: Nullify out variables before extracting metadata.
	In case of error, NULL TrackerSparqlBuilders will be returned by
	get_file_metadata().

	tracker-extract: Return statements if LSA is used.

	Fix typo in libtracker-extract documentation.

	Align together insert_open/close() in the MP3 and vorbis extractors.
	This is more readable than having the closing function called inside
	the next if clause.

	TrackerWriteback: Fix indenting/readability of a code fragment.

	Replaced _:foo with _:file
	A somewhat more descriptive name.

	Remove mistakenly added g_free() in the MP3 extractor.
	that variable is freed later after being used for albumart.

	Plug 2 leaks.

	Plug some leaks in the PDF extractor.

	Avoid early g_free().
	The variable piece_table is pointing to ctx, so the ctx memory still
	has to be valid while dealing with piece_table.

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Get all children URIs in a single query when moving a folder.
	nfo:belongsToContainer isn't used since at the moment the data in there
	is not actually reliable.

	Ensure the dest path info is removed before a move operation.
	Also, now nie:isStoredAs is updated properly.

	Ensure nie:isStoredAs is set to the object URN.

	TrackerSearchBar: Fix opening files.

	Adapt tracker-search-bar to not use URI=ID.

	Fix tracker-tag so no URI=ID is assumed.

	Make tracker-search show the item URI if it exists.

2010-02-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	DROP GRAPH now uses the value of nie:url instead of subjects

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make tracker-info work again with URNs besides URIs and paths.

	Fix typo when creating preupdate queries.
	the wrong TrackerSparqlBuilder was being used on some calls.

	Still use URI as graph name.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Allow late addition of tracker:mountPoint.
	Since the URNs are now anonymous, we might not know yet the mount
	point URN, so this data is added when the mount point GFile is
	processed.

	Normalize paths so getting the UDI for the mount dir GFile works.
	Also, a leak in that function was fixed.

2010-02-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Fixed a critical warning on Writeback()

	Compilation warning fix

	Fixed the tracker-writeback function to cope with anonymous blank nodes
	Files now have an anonymous blank node as subject, this means that the subject
	no longer is the same as nie:url. This commit fixes this situation.

	Fixed bug with nmm:albumTrackCount being set to different values
	... for the same album, which was failing the insert query for
	the entire song

	Added support for DELETE to TrackerSparqlBuilder class

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Turn preinserts into more generic preupdate.
	Now implementations must open/close inserts themselves, since more
	than just inserts could be added there.

	Fix commit 07580f1 to use preinserts for affiliation info.

	Make tracker-info not rely on ID==URI.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Use new tracker-extract API to compose insertions.
	The newer tracker-extract DBus API is used and later composed into
	a single query. Also, some miscellaneous places that didn't rely on
	ID!=URI have been changed.

	Modify tracker-extract to return 2 sparql strings.
	The first argument will be preinserts, which are the necessary
	insertions that actual file metadata rely on. The second argument
	is just a collection of data triples so it can be inserted together
	with the rest of the data in the miner.

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to add WHERE clauses.
	where_open(), where_close() and subject_variable() have been added.

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to prepend a raw string.
	This can be used by miners to compose together any prerequisite
	insertion (for example, artist/album in audio files) with the actual
	entity data (the audio file in this case).

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to allow embedded insertions.
	Embedded insertions may take triples so data taken from tracker-extract
	can be afterwards inserted together with the rest of the data in the
	miner.

	dbus data for the miner. Subsequently, disabling and then enabling the
	plugin would try to re-register the miner's name and find it was in
	use and so exit() would be called in libtracker-miner. Now this
	is fixed and Evolution doesn't completely exit.

	Post review fixes for configure.ac

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Use a separate thread to dispatch DBus writeback signals.
	TrackerWritebackDispatcher has been splitted into dispatcher/consumer.
	The former runs in a separate thread, listening for writeback signals
	from tracker-store and notifying the main thread about them. The consumer
	just has these petitions queued and processes them one by one,

	This way, operations performed by the consumer may be blocking, while
	the dispatcher will be able to receive DBus signals at any time.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Added some more fields to the XMP writeback module

2009-11-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Refactored content-type check to abstract TrackerWritebackFile

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make sure the fd isn't closed as long as the lock stays.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Handling writeback in tracker-miner-fs
	When a writeback takes place, tracker-miner-fs must NOT create a SPARQL Update
	that contains any predicates that are marked as tracker:notify. For this
	reason I added a mechanism for marking a subject in tracker-miner-fs's queues:
	The first next time the subject is to be analyzed it checks whether the
	subject was marked. If it was marked then instead of doing a full extraction,
	tracker-miner-fs will only get a few properties (like mime, mtime, size).

	* MIME because the content-type of a file might have changed by writeback
	* Size because the size of the file might have changed by writeback
	* Mtime because the writeback will update the file's mtime, and we want
	  to sync tracker-store with that too

	Added writeback module for XMP

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerWritebackDispatcher: add sanity check on returned metadata.

	TrackerWritebackMP3: Make it inherit from TrackerWritebackFile.

	TrackerWritebackFile: Added base implementation for local files.
	This object implements file locking for local files, and provides an
	specialized vmethod as well.

	tracker-file-utils.c: Add file locking API.
	This API will be used by the writeback service, so TrackerMinerFS
	implementations don't obey updates while metadata is being written.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Added filter for the list of rdf:type being passed vs. module to elect

	Pass the known list of rdf:types to the Writeback signal

	Only report writeback for default graph

	Implemented writeback for MP3's Title field using id3lib
	This is a prototype implementation

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-writeback: Hook writeback modules to the dispatcher.
	There's still work left to do, the dispatcher should maintain a mimetype/module
	hashtable, so it can create TrackerWriteback objects for each file, right now
	the first found module (currently the dummy one) is used.

	TrackerWriteback: add dummy module.
	Modules will derive from the TrackerWriteback object, its API has to be devised
	yet.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Changed from using a method to listening on the Writeback signal
	Also added a small sample that calls back in on_sparql_result_received that
	will simply print all the statements that have predicate tracker:writeback set

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Add initial tracker-writeback implementation.
	It does close to nothing at the moment, but functionality will be added over
	time.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Signalling Writeback in case a property marked as tracker:writeback is changed

	All miner SPARQL Update queries need FROM or INTO to avoid writeback
	When INTO or FROM are passed, graph in tracker_writeback_check wont be NULL.
	A NULL graph means 'default graph' or 'something that came from the user'.
	We only want to do writeback for things that came from the user. This is how
	we distinguish between content from the miner and content from the user.

2009-11-24  Adrien Bustany  <madcat@mymadcat.com>

	libtracker-miner: Make TrackerMiner use standard gio callbacks and port TrackerMinerFS
	TrackerMiner previously used custom callbacks for its async calls
	tracker_miner_execute_sparql, tracker_miner_execute_update etc. This commit
	changes the API to make them use the standard GLib callback pattern
	my_callback (GObject *source, GAsyncResult *result, gpointer user_data) .
	The API of TrackerMinerFS is not changed, but it's internaly ported to the
	new functions.
	The miners using the tracker_miner_* functions have to be ported to use
	the new API.
	This patch also ports the existing miners.

2009-11-23  Juan A. Suarez Romero  <jasuarez@igalia.com>

	Fixes GB#598470,  Search entry icons grayed out

	Fixes NB#600973, tracker-control: don't use "-h" to remove thumbnails

2009-11-23  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Critical messages are fine for most impl errors.
	Miner implementations weren't able to extract metadata, probably for a good
	reason, so issue critical warnings for all of them, but the "file not found"
	case.

2009-11-23  Juan A. Suarez Romero  <jasuarez@igalia.com>

2009-11-23  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fixed redundant code.
	Spotted by Philip.

	libtracker-miner: Fixed memory corruption for dir moves
	Philip spotted this after Tshepang's testing. There are three issues
	this patch fixes:

	1. Inserting a GFile into a hash table without incrementing a
	reference causes a reference count problem and leads to using memory
	which is no longer valid.

	2. Using the same INotifyHandle* for a different directory name is
	broken and that's what we were doing when moving directories.

	3. We should actually recursively be removing all old monitors and
	re-adding monitors for the new sub-directory names.

	tracker-extract: Fixed link errors using binutils-gold's ld

	libtracker-common: Fixed tests linking errors with binutils-gold's ld

	tracker-extract: Fix autofoo warnings about unused mockup_SOURCES

	libtracker-miner: Fixed example linking with binutils-gold's ld

	libtracker-miner: Moved test/ directory to examples/
	I did this because although it does test the API, it also shows it off
	like tracker-miner-fs. This is mostly a good way to show others how to
	build their own miners.

	libtracker-miner: Updated test case to use ::finished not ::terminated
	Actually, ::terminated is completely unused and should probably be
	removed at some point.

	tracker-miner-fs: Removed unused tracker_storage_new() call
	This was resulting in us listing and iterating all HAL devices twice
	each time miner-fs was started

	tracker-miner-fs: Index $HOME one level deep by default

	tracker-extract-mp3: Extract nmm:albumTrackCount if available

	tracker-miner-fs: Fix SPARQL for files without extracted metadata
	A call to tracker_sparql_builder_insert_close was missing for files
	where the extractor does not return any metadata leading to invalid
	SPARQL being sent to tracker-store.

	libtracker-common: Check when retrieving SPARQL builder result
	Warn when retrieving SPARQL builder result in wrong state as, for
	example, with a missing insert_close call.

2009-11-17  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Add IM details to IM Contact
	IMContact represents a contact coming from an IMAccount. Added

	Ontology: Fixed nmm:exposureTime to be a double not an integer

	tracker-extract: Don't use _object_unvalidated() for 'nfo:Document'

2009-11-04  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract-imagemagick.c: Use TrackerSparqlBuilder.

	tracker-extract-abw.c: Use TrackerSparqlBuilder.

	tracker-extract-gstreamer.c: Use TrackerSparqlBuilder.

	TrackerSparqlBuilder: add object_double() method.

	Coalesce nie:comment in jpeg extractor.
	comment info may come from builtin and exif data. Coalesce both, since
	nie:comment only allows one value.

	Don't pick empty strings when coalescing data.

	configure.ac: Detect the correct libvorbis library.
	We actually use libvorbisfile in the vorbis extractor.

	SPARQL: Fix fts:rank when fts:match is not first predicate in query

2009-11-04  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Fixed a big in delete_resource_description about usage of cursors
	The outer query's cursor's statement was being reused by the inner queries'
	cursors' statements in some situations (where the outer query was identical to
	the inner queries). We don't yet support this.

	You can revert this patch as soon as we do support this.

2009-11-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Bugfix return value of albumart_set

	Updated Polish translation

2009-11-03  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Ontology: Added more FTS fields

	Ontology: Added tracker:weight to more ontology properties
	This is a pretty comprehensive update too. All values range from 2-10.
	1 is used for properties which have no tracker:weight defined anyway.

	tracker-search-bar: Fixed order by to asc and to title from urn

2009-11-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Allowing different image libraries to deal with albumart image formats
	Split the code that uses pixbuf out of tracker-albumart.c into four files:
	  - tracker-albumart-quill.cpp : C++ code that uses libquill for this
	  - tracker-albumart-pixbuf.c  : C code that uses GdkPixbuf forthis
	  - tracker-albumart-dummy.c   : C code that does nothing but return FALSE,
	                                 elected in case both are absent
	  - tracker-albumart-generic.h : Generic API for above

2009-11-03  John Carr  <john.carr@unrouted.co.uk>

	Add AC_CACHE_CHECK magic around ioprio checking.
	Having the cache check allows the end user to set whether ioprio
	is available or not. Without this cross-compilation is not
	possible as there is no way to run the test program.

	TrackerMinerFiles: provide better errors when initializing volumes.

	TrackerMiner: Don't try to free invalid pointers.
	the result GPtrArray might not be a valid pointer if error is set, so only
	free it if the sparql query was successful. Also, don't try to free it twice,
	although this was safe due to tracker_dbus_results_ptr_array_free() nullifying
	the pointer after freeing.

	tracker-search-bar: Make searching interactive with 300ms delay

	Fixes GB#600081, Get rid of Bonobo

2009-11-02  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fixed ref docs WS and updated to new APIs

	tracker-store: Fixed headers

	tracker-processes: Renamed to tracker-control, now in src/tracker-control

2009-10-28  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: Fix up prototype for ::finished.
	The ::finished signal changed parameters some time ago, but the function
	prototype in the class struct didn't.

	tracker-extract: initialize albumart on standalone mode as well.
	This was reporting critical warnings from non-initialized caches in there.

	Plug a bunch of potential leaks.
	For some cases, word wasn't even used, for others the code would try to
	fill in the same tag several times, leaking the older values.

	tracker-extract-mp3.c: Retrieve nmm:trackNumber.
	Also, track number is dealt everywhere as a integer, so no strings are leaked.

	tracker-extract-mp3: Add missing break; when parsing id3v20 tags.
	This could lead to doubly freed memory, since the same string was assigned
	to genre and copyright.

2009-10-28  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Add ontology log output line for G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO

	tracker-extract: Filter all file based ontology from LSA extractor

	SPARQL: Do not leak variables (reference cycle)

2009-10-27  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Use G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO for the SPARQL output
	This allows us to use verbosity=1 to just see the SPARQL output and
	nothing else.

	tracker-extract: Removed some logging on start up
	Based on a patch from 0.6 for NB#126773, trackerd and tracker-extract
	spam syslog. See commit 65adc16dc0183a1a9b08eb85440312399748262a.

	libtracker-common: Fixed logging so G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO is verbosity=1

	tracker-extract: clean up libstreamanalyzer integration a bit

2009-10-26  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Use update buffer for deletes as well
	This fixes handling of FTS updates when deleting or updating property
	values by reusing the logic written for inserts.

	libtracker-data: Factor out function string_to_gvalue

	libtracker-data: Factor out function get_old_property_values

	SPARQL: Flush update buffer after DROP GRAPH

	libtracker-data: Add rollback callback
	This prevents sending events for updates that are rolled back.

2009-10-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@gnome.org>

	TrackerMinerFiles: Don't overwrite throttle settings.
	Throttle is already being set based on battery status in constructed(), don't
	overwrite that setting.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Unify battery state handling.
	Having on_battery and on_low_battery separated separatedly actually had logic
	gaps, such as low battery + charging state, and was setting throttling
	regardless of the AC power state.

2009-10-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Codestyle and indentation for the StreamAnalyzer support

2009-10-26  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	maemo: Add maemo:relevance property

2009-10-22  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: store as many words as the FTS config says.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: Do not spam tracker-status-icon.
	Now actual processing is reported in miner progress, not walking through every
	mail folder, which made progress signalling go crazy.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: Send sparql updates without waiting for reply.
	The number of DBus messages send may be huge, and it may take long for them to
	be answered, clobbering the pending calls hashtable. This fixes some random
	OOM observed when sending ~30K messages.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: free error in DBus responses if any.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: plug a leak.

2009-10-22  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Extend update buffer
	Support multiple resources in the update buffer at the same time to
	improve performance for certain types of insert statements.

	Add omitted files for GB#570608

2009-10-20  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make progress go forward in the Evolution miner.
	Progress calculation was based on items left, so it actually went backwards
	for tracker-status-icon.

	Make the evo plugin use the same DBus name everywhere.
	This was preventing TrackerMinerManager to keep track of it.

2009-10-19  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Update mtime checking with latest tracker-store requirements.
	mtimes are now stored with timezone info in tracker-store, TrackerMinerFS should
	use the same format when checking a file has been modified.

	TrackerConfigFile: Also make create events trigger reparsing.
	Create events from the file monitor was being sort of ignored, with this
	TrackerConfigFile reparses configuration correctly with the technique used
	by tracker-preferences to rewrite the config.

	clear what path is taken for each file.

2009-10-16  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Remove sqlite3 command line dependency
	It was used in some old tests that don't exist anymore

2009-10-15  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Right command in the tests script

2009-10-15  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-status-icon: Set default progress/fraction as 100%
	We do this because if the status icon is restarted for some reason, it
	then is usually correct until the next progress update.

	tracker-status-icon: Make progress menu more visually attractive

2009-10-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-preferences: Allow configuring status icon visibility.

	TrackerStatusIcon: Add config to tweak status icon visibility.
	A new config file has been added for tracker-status-icon. At the moment
	the only setting is for visibility, possible values are never/always/when
	active.

2009-10-15  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Simple test case to try tests in integration.

2009-10-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-store: Remove all traces of TrackerStorage.
	This is handled by tracker-miner-fs itself, TrackerStorage callbacks were
	mere stubs, this is now removed.

	TrackerMinerFS: Do not loop infinitely when unmounting while processing.

2009-10-14  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Fix timezone handling when inserting time_t

	libtracker-data: Fix transaction handling
	Make sure to rollback all changes when an error happens during a
	SPARQL update.

	libtracker-db: Make sure SQLite statement is reset when using cursors
	Statement reset is only implicit if all results are read. A missing
	reset can lock the database, so we need to make sure to always reset
	unused statements.

2009-10-14  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	New nmm:Playlist class

	Fix tracker_language_stem_word().
	the case with stemming disabled was completely broken, not taking into account
	word_length, and returning a dup'ed string as const gchar*. Made it more
	consistent by always returning a duplicated string, and taking into account
	word_length in non-stemmer case. The only caller has been updated as well.

	Improve docs for libtracker-common.

	TrackerConfigFile: Turned into an abstract object.

2009-10-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't index duplicate MMC and config paths
	Previously, if a removable device was mounted on $HOME/foo and
	$HOME/foo was in tracker-miner-fs.cfg, it would be iterated twice. Now
	we check for this and drop the .cfg version in favour of the removable
	device mount point.

	libtracker-common: Now normalise paths returned in tracker-storage

	libtracker-common: Fixed inconsistent GSList returns and mem leak
	The API was inconsistent here. Some API calls returned a GSList with
	pointers and some returned a GSList with newly allocated pointers. Now
	everything is newly allocated.

	The return value in tracker-miner-files.c is now freed when getting
	removable devices too.

	Fixed documentation warnings for missing libtracker-common symbols

	libtracker-common: Use GSList for tracker-storage* API

	libtracker-common: Removed unnecessary casts and reverse lists prepended

2009-10-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make the PDF extractor use tracker_text_normalize().

	Add FTS support for MS and ODF document formats.

	Add tracker_text_normalize()
	This function is meant for FTS in extractors, receives UTF8 text and tries to
	strip non-text characters, extra spaces, carriage returns and such, providing
	a suitable string for nie:plainTextContent.

2009-10-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix up API docs for libtracker-miner.
	GObject docs weren't being generated due to object and class structs not being
	added to libtracker-miner-sections.txt, also tracker_miner_fs_notify_file() has
	been added there.

	TrackerMinerFS: turn process_file() into a signal.
	This has been done to fit better with the rest of the API, also
	tracker_miner_fs_notify_file() has been added to replace the callback
	parameter, since implementations can do metadata extraction asynchronously,
	they'll be responsible of calling this function. Applications and files miners
	have been modified.

	TrackerMinerFS: make it possible to process files parallelly.
	Now there is a pool of files being processed, controlled by the
	TrackerMinerFS::process-pool-limit (default value of 1), which
	specifies the maximum number of files that can be processed at
	the same time. Code flow has changed so no new files are processed
	until there is room in the pool.

	TrackerMiner: Remove application parameter from tracker_miner_pause().
	This is not necessary for internal use, just for the DBus API, it now
	uses internally either g_get_application_name() or TrackerMiner::name.

	tracker-miner-fs: Use XDG spec for special user dirs in config
	This means now the user can specify "&USER_DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS" and it
	will point to whatever the XDG config says in
	/etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults and use those dynamically.

	For now saving the config back is not supported so well. This can be
	improved in the future and it is currently unused in tracker-miner-fs
	anyway. The preferences need some love after this too.

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't try to send thumbs if service is disabled

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't send 0 thumbnail sized queues
	Also print we are sending the items BEFORE we send them to make
	logging clearer when the proxy is NULL or we get some errors from the

2009-09-29  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	somewhat random memory.

	libtracker-client: Make it able to cancel individual calls.
	All async functions return a guint which can be used in tracker_cancel_call()
	so the call is cancelled, tracker_cancel_last_call() now also uses this
	infrastructure, although this function should be deprecated/removed at some
	point.

2009-09-25  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

2009-09-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	  tracker-processes
	  tracker-search-bar

	Updated some old texts left in others.

	tracker-status-icon: Update --help about one liner

	Please always use either SparqlUpdate or BatchSparqlUpdate followed by
	BatchCommit for inserting and removing statements.

2009-09-25  Michael Biebl  <biebl@debian.org>

	Sort file list in POTFILES.{in,skip} alphabetically

	Update list of translatable / non-translatable files
	Update POTFILES.{in,skip} after the merge of the evolution branch to
	fix "make check"

	Remove duplicate EXTRA_DIST / CLEANFILES
	EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES were specified twice, the second overriding
	the first. As a result $(desktop_in_files) was not added to the dist
	tarball.

	Remove DIST_SUBDIRS
	automake will handle DIST_SUBDIRS correctly automatically for SUBDIRS
	which are added conditionally. Specifying them manually actually breaks
	"make distclean" and subsequently "make distcheck". So simply remove it.

2009-09-24  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	Merge branch 'evolution'

	Refactoring of the Evolution push plugin

2009-09-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerResultsWindow: Cache the pixbufs in the model.
	Getting the icons can be quite expensive, these are now cached in the model.

	TrackerResultsWindow: Open selected items on row-activated.

	TrackerResultsWindow: grab pointer/keyboard on popup.
	This makes the results window behave as expected wrt keyboard handling for the
	treeview and pressing esc or clicking outside the window to pop it out.

	Turn TrackerResultsWindow into a GtkWidget.
	It inherits from TrackerAlignedWindow, and does some things in a more proper
	way.

2009-09-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-status: Fixed typo in --help

	tracker-search: Now can use FTS with category searching
	Now when using options like --images the search terms can be
	used. Previously this only worked with no command line switch.

	Now added some more categories too, such as:

	 --folders
	 --videos
	 --documents

	Renamed:

	 --image-files to --images
	 --music-files to --music

2009-09-23  Michael Biebl  <biebl@debian.org>

	Add missing files to POTFILES.in
	According to 4ddf3304d4c3909ab9ec9cf56edcb495e1d634c3 the miner desktop
	files should be translatable, so add them to POTFILES.in.

2009-09-23  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerStatusIcon: use tracker_miner_manager_get_display_name().

	TrackerMinerManager: Rely on desktop files to get to know miners data.
	Also, tracker_miner_manager_get_display_name() has been added, it can
	be used to get a translated display name for the miner, instead of
	stripping things from the DBus name.

	Add .desktop files for miners.
	These are installed in $(datadir)/tracker/miners, and will be used to
	get to know available miners, translatable display name/comment,
	DBus name/path, and other relevant data.

	tracker-explorer: Fix build with vala master

2009-09-14  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Fixes: NB#138860, tracker-miner-fs stops crawling if a directory...
	This was caused by returning TRUE to silently handle missing
	directories, the problem is, we then depend on a "finished" signal
	from the crawler which we never get. As such, we now return FALSE in
	the _start() function if we don't expect to progress any further.

	Also, we now don't reset the GCancellable and don't set the crawler
	into state "running" until the initial checks are done first.

	libtracker-miner: Fix crash and memory leak in crawler

2009-09-13  Jorge González  <jorgegonz@svn.gnome.org>

	Updated Spanish translation

2009-09-11  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFiles: Hook check-directory-contents to configuration.

	TrackerMinerFS: Forward the check-directory-contents signals.
	This way miner implementations may choose whether to index a folder or not
	based on its contents.

	TrackerCrawler: Add check-directory-contents signal.
	This signal contains both the folder and its children (in a GList), the return
	value will tell TrackerCrawler whether to keep iterating through that folder
	or discard it.

	Fixed duplicate sending of class-signal SubjectsAdded

2009-09-10  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: Do not iterate through folders parallelly.
	Previously to this change, the process_func() idle function would be always
	running, starting iteration through folders as soon as the could be processed,
	regardless of having other folders already being iterated. This could lead
	to an scenario where all file descriptors were used under some conditions.

	Now, all processing is fully sequential, so process_func() waits until a
	folder is iterated before going on to the next item.

2009-09-10  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Ported volume support to libtracker-miner API

	tracker-sparql: Fix documentation and --help for --update option

2009-09-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Plug some leaks in libtracker-miner and tracker-miner-fs.

	TrackerMinerFS: Ensure the timer is created after initial crawling.
	After initial crawling timer is freed and set to NULL, this ensures that events
	coming from the monitor will also have a timer enabled for measurements.

	libtracker-data: Fix DROP GRAPH with datetime and boolean properties

2009-09-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Don't signal status/progress so much & remove dups

	tracker-miner-fs: Applications miner small code improvements

	libtracker-miner: Don't disable monitoring during crawling
	This meant that no monitors were getting added even though the log
	said the opposite, this was because we added a NULL pointer to the
	hash table for each GFile.

2009-09-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	tracker-extract: Removed unused code & handle content == NULL

2009-09-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Lower the severity of a warning.
	Having a hanging cancellable is not warning worthy. Also, make sure it's NULL
	if process_file() returns FALSE.

	TrackerMinerApplications: Avoid unnecessary warnings.
	Now process_file() returns FALSE if the passed file is not a parseable
	.desktop file, which means the file will be bypassed.

	Rename tracker-applet manpage.

	Remove all tracker-applet references from autofoo.

	Fix POTFILES.* for tracker-status-icon.

2009-09-08  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Fixed a crash in init of removable devices
	The initialize_removable_devices function gets a list of paths which it passed
	to tracker_miner_fs_add_directory, which in turn wants a GFile instance. The
	fix converts the path to a GFile before calling the latter function.

	This takes into account idle/paused/active/inactive miners.

2009-09-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-sparql: Added command line options to make using SPARQL easier
	Added:
	--list-classes
	--list-class-prefixes
	--list-properties

	This allows people to quickly find out what classes we support, the
	prefix they can use for them (to make life easier) and the properties
	associated with a class. The class prefix can be used to get
	properties too.

	tracker-sparql: Removed mingw include

	tracker-sparql: Renamed --path option to --file
	This in so we can add a --properties (-p) option later and because we
	are not pointing to a directory but a filename.

	libtracker-data: Remove unused function tracker_data_insert_resource

2009-09-02  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Added initial version of tracker-status-icon.
	There are some things missing, the context menu has been ripped from
	tracker-applet, but doesn mostly nothing. It's also missing code to pause
	miners and to switch to idle mode after they're all done.

	TrackerCrawler: Don't starve file crawling if there are higher prio sources.
	A higher priority source running that often is worrying enough to deserve
	a close look, this is a quick fix so the crawler doesn't get stuck.

	any sparql additions will trigger a commit.

	TrackerMiner: Add tracker_miner_commit().
	This function also takes pausing into account.

2009-08-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	tracker-miner-fs: Do not start an already started miner.

	TrackerMiner: Add tracker_miner_is_started().

	TrackerMinerFS: Use the accumulator for the boolean signals.

	TrackerMinerFS: Remove unused vars.

	TrackerMinerFS: No need to disconnect signals, we own these objects.
	TrackerMinerFS owns both the crawler and the monitor, so these won't survive
	finalization, so there's no need to disconnect signals before unref'ing.

2009-08-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Make sure we call the parent class constructed first

	Fix TrackerCrawler call now we use GFile instead of path

	Add dir ignore patterns and moved silly crawl dir checks to start

2009-08-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Improve checks on whether a file/dir should be indexed.
	For events coming from the monitor, we just call check-file/directory, since
	the mtime has changed for sure. For crawling, tell the crawler to inspect all
	directories, but mark these which mtime hasn't changed so they can be ignored

	libtracker-common: Improve formatting in SPARQL builder

	tracker-miner-fs: Fix SPARQL for folders

	libtracker-data: Fix crash on FTS update
	It's important that buildTerms is never called more than once with
	the same iDocid and iColumn arguments. If this condition is not
	obeyed, asserts may be triggered leading to segmentation faults.

2009-08-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Bugfix

	TrackerConfigFile: get rid of "lt-" prefixes in app names.

2009-08-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Rework the way we mine the file system data
	Now we queue all files first then process them. This allows us to get
	some idea of how many we have for status and progress reports.

	The tracker-crawler now changed signals from process-file and
	process-directory to check-file and check-directory.

	Small code cleanups/realignments

2009-08-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Don't stop the timer when printing stats, not need

	Rename all variable names for TrackerMinerFiles to mf
	This is to distinguish them from other type variables related to
	miners.

	Moved binary name from tracker-miner-fs-new to tracker-miner-fs

	Fixed all Miner->FS namespace changes

	Renamed tracker-miner-process to tracker-miner-fs

	Make sure we ALWAYS force checks on directories and NEVER ignore them
	Unless they are ignored by the config of course.

	Added ignore rules and patterns from config
	Also moved functions around so class functions are organised at the top

	Fixed config API for ignored patterns s/ignore/ignored/

	Function name clean up

	Clear debugging about the type of path we are processing

	Don't monitor ALL directories, i.e. make sure we ignore hidden directories

	Fixed memory leak for GFileInfo and warning when info is NULL

	Move config options around so they are more logically groupped

	Renamed the DisableIndexOnBattery options to make more sense

	Removed Monitor config and merged it into index config
	Also added a separate option for recursive and non-recursive crawling
	not just recursive paths.

	Added missing TrackerConfig APIs for new config options

2009-08-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Avoid double unref.

	The directories are already added in TrackerMinerFiles constructor.

	TrackerMinerProcess: Do not start crawling until the miner is started.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Remove mount point directory on pre-unmount.

	TrackerCrawler: use GCancellable to stop GIO operations.

2009-08-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Rename Miner.FS to Miner.Files so tracker-status finds it

	Add miners list and start them one after each other not same time

	Don't use been_started AND process_dir_id and emit finished signal

	Make sure we call constructed for the parent class first.
	This is why the FS miner wasn't appearing on dbus

	Added additional checks from original code for checking file/dirs

	Use defined attributes for g_file_query_info() instead of strings

	Use G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_IS_HIDDEN instead of string

2009-08-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: invert meaning of process-file/dir return value once again.
	Now a custom accumulator is used with inverted logic to

	The meaning of the boolean return value in these signals is now inverted.
	Returning TRUE will also stop further processing, so the default
	implementations for these signals won't be able to clobber the result of

	anymore. The processing is now taken care by an async idle so no recursion
	problems are possible.

2009-08-21  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Added tracker-status command line options to list running/available miners

	Add tracker-miner-discover to find DBus miner services
	This also makes use of tracker-crawler to find .service files in the
	DBus services directory, the debugging from tracker-crawler was
	unavoidable so the g_debug and g_message statements have been moved to
	tracker-miner-process instead so it can decide if it wants to print
	found/ignored things.

	Also the tracker-crawler finished signal now includes WAS_INTERRUPTED
	boolean so we know if it was stopped prematurely.

	Add missing GetDescription method to DBus xml file

2009-07-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Added the volume for the root-fs

2009-07-29  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: fixed thumbnailer warnings

	Moved thumbnailer.[ch] and volume-cleanup.[ch] to tracker-miner-fs
	Also while doing this, some make distcheck issues were fixed.

	We no longer require tracker-marshal-main.c to include
	tracker-marshal.[ch], this is done automatically now.

	tests/tracker-store/ was created and the tracker-events-test.c was
	moved here from tests/tracker-miner-fs. This is still broken for some
	reason so disabled for now.

2009-07-29  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix parameters order in g_debug() call.

	Do volumes initialization in a more efficient manner.
	Now tracker-miner-fs gets a list of mounted volumes, according to both HAL and
	tracker-store, then does the diff and just updates state of changed volumes.

2009-07-29  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	Enable/disable files availability when volumes are mounted/unmounted.
	There are lots of dead code to remove with this commit. This also takes into
	account volumes initialization during tracker-miner-fs startup.

2009-07-28  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Removing the fulltext values from the FTS store

2009-07-28  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	tracker-extract: don't try to insert NULL genres in gstreamer module

	tracker-miner-fs: move albumart extraction to tracker-extract
	Now we do the processing in tracker-extract and only request the
	thumbnail for the albumart to be queued from tracker-miner-fs. This
	saves us sending potentially large album art over dbus

	Don't print invalid UTF-8 warnings in tracker-statement-list
	This is of no use. Some things WILL be invalid anyway and printing
	them doesn't help, all it does is raise concerns.

	Disabled setrlimit for now, it is causing problems with gstreamer

	Enable unit tests by default so they are included in make distcheck

2009-07-28  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-fts: Fix use of invalid SQL inside DELETE implementation

	tracker-miner-fs: fix crash receving album art raw data

	libtracker-common: fixed weird indentation in keyfile-object

	Add \n after interrupt signals

	tracker-miner-fs: albumart messaging clean up

	tracker-miner-fs: moved in tracker-albumart code from libtracker-common
	All the code in libtracker-common/tracker-albumart.[ch] which was used
	from multiple places is only used in miner-fs now so I moved the
	functions into the tracker-miner-fs/tracker-albumart.[ch] and removed
	the libtracker-common module.

	tracker-extract: push all albumart code to tracker-miner-fs
	Now we signal data that is used to be processed for albumart. This is
	all handled in the miner-fs now, so the extractors simply say, here is
	my data and length of data (and some other details like artist), now
	process it. The miner-fs then uses the code previously
	tracker-extract-albumart.c to either download the art, use GdkPixbuf
	or save the data directly to the right filename. The thumbnails are
	then requested staight after.

	tracker-extract: renamed tracker-extract-albumart to tracker-albumart
	This was not an extractor in the first place, just a helper module

	tracker-extract: Sanitise the albumart code with an init/shutdown function
	Also added an initial dbus signal for tracker-extract to be able to
	tell the tracker-miner-fs about new files that need thumbnailing.

	Renamed config modules to reflect real roles
	tracker-config-manager is now tracker-config-file
	tracker-config-utils is now tracker-keyfile-object

2009-07-23  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Use SQL UNION ALL instead of just UNION
	UNION without ALL implies DISTINCT, which can lead to bad performance.

2009-07-23  Benjamin Otte  <otte@gnome.org>

	Improve performance for SparqlBuilder.object_string
	Don't check characters one-by-one but instead use strcspn to find the
	next character to escape. This improves performance for this function
	significantly.

2009-07-20  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixed make distcheck failures

	tracker-fts: added config module
	Removed the FTS config options from tracker-store too

	Moved config functions and modules around
	Now we have tracker-config-manager which is used to do all file based
	operations for the config file. We also have tracker-config-utils
	which does all the GKeyFile<-->GObject work for us. 

	Perhaps these should be renamed at some point to:

	  tracker-config-file
	  tracker-object-keyfile

	To be more aligned to what they actually do.

	libtracker-common: Build log filename automatically from binary name

	tracker-miner-fs: Removed local config options which were not applicable

	Moved tracker-config to tracker-global-config, 1st phase
	This change involves creating a tracker-config in the miner-fs based
	on the original config module. It will be cut down for miner only
	config.

	Fix iterating OVER every other device in the processor's list

	Fixed trackerd crasher when shutting down if started in readonly mode

	Check space before creating DBs && disable indexer API when paused
	The debugging is also a bit clearer when we are below the disk space
	threshold as set in the config. The frequency of these messages is
	slightly longer too so we don't fill the logs up so quickly.

	Ported to master by Philip

	Monitor cache time now 1s & processor queue time now 0s for < 50 items
	Now we only wait 1 second before sending files to the processor from
	the monitor module. The reason for this, is to be more responsive from
	monitor events. Now a DELETE event is handled within 1 to 2 seconds if
	the indexer is idle.

	The processor queue handler is set up using a 2 second timeout per
	1000 files. Now when we have finished the initial check of all files,
	we use g_idle_add() instead to make sure the indexer deals with items
	much quicker.

	Rework the processors device and module logic so it is clearer
	This also cleans up some of the debugging so there is less of it. It
	is also now less likely we end up in recursive loops because of real
	time updates from removable devices being inserted and removed (the
	logic here is much simpler and comprehensible

2009-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Implemented playlist extractor for fresh Nepomuk-based ontology

	Fixed state machine so we return to previous state after PAUSED
	This bug was simulated by setting the LowDiskSpaceLimit in the config
	to 99 and then starting the daemon. Then setting it to 1 in real time
	should start sending files to the indexer, but instead it was returned
	to PENDING state which meant the queue handler returned and didn't do
	anything since it was expecting IDLE. IDLE was attempted but denied
	given pause conditions.

	Bug NB#118578 - Getting metadata with mafw_playlist_get_items_md fails.
	Make volumes initialization completely sync without running the main loop,
	so it doesn't process petitions before the DBus interfaces are properly
	set up.

	Fixes NB#100123, nie:contentCreated is empty for some of the images

	Fix not crawling inserted removable media
	Now we start the processor again when we get new removable media
	inserted, this bug mainly affects the condition when we have finished
	processing all files and the removable media state changes again.

	The statistics we report about files crawled and time taken is now
	reset and correct each time this occurs.

	The mount point added and removed callbacks from HAL were removed in
	TrackerProcessor and now two functions are called FROM tracker-main.c
	which do the same thing. The reason for this, is that we change state
	while setting volume states and we can't process removable media in
	some states. So to control this we do everything AFTER we have set the
	removable media states correctly.

2009-06-12  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes: NB#119230, tracker-extract: memory management shall be improved
	This is another stab at using setrlimit(). For now we set the memory
	limit to 80Mb as default and 512Mb for AMD. For some reason, anything
	less than ~450Mb doesn't even allow tracker-extract to dlopen the
	modules when we use GStreamer.

	Doing a quick test with tracker-stats before and after shows it is
	working on my AMD64 desktop and still indexing the same amount of
	content.

2009-05-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	The solution to the 2.5s per 10k items: simply lower the priority of the queue
	This is my analysis about this: It was actually clear when Jürg told me did
	his tests without letting the store-queue's idle handler run. My first idea was
	to also disable it for my tests, and then suddenly 10k inserts finished within
	0.135s instead of 2.5s (latter was a quite dissapointing result, former is the
	expected result).

	My analysis is the following: the queue's GSource had an equal priority as the
	unix socket's GSource of the GIOChannel.

	Meaning that if we lower the priority of the queue's GSource, lower than the
	GSource of the unix socket's GIOChannel, that the latter will run at speed.

	With this mini-patch test tests/estress/socket_stress_test.c will finish in
	about 0.135s on an average desktop. The queue will of course have a lot of
	work afterwards, but any subsequent request on the unix-socket (and probably
	also on DBus, as also DBus's GSource now runs at a higher priority that the
	queue's) will get priority.

	This allows us to queue 10000 INSERT queries in 0.135s instead of 2.5s and yet
	we don't need to halt or disable the queue itself.

	I made this rather large analysis because this apparently is what makes the
	difference in IPC responsiveness for tracker-store's queue design.

	    Jürg had the luminous idea to ask me to change the queue API a bit

	    The changes include:
	     - Rename TrackerStoreQueue to TrackerStore
	     - Rename batch to queue
	     - Don't put single update and single queries on the queue
	     - Handle transaction-max in tracker-store.c, don't make the callers have
	       to care about it

	    This last one implied that I could remove most of the ++priv->batch_count
	    callbacks from tracker-resource.c and that I had to fixup the push modules
	    a bit too.

	    Sorting of the queue

	    The updates, statement_insert, statement_delete and queries follow
	    natural order in priority group. The batch_update, batch_statement_insert
	    and batch_commit follow natural order in non-prioritized group.

	    Sample order:

	    query
	    delete_statement
	    query
	    update
	    insert_statement
	    batch_update
	    batch_update

	Date:   Thu May 21 10:40:37 2009 +0200

	    Introduced TrackerStoreQueue, a queue for querying and updating

	    TrackerStoreQueue is or will be the internal API for most data access and
	    storage. This current implementation uses the GMainLoop and a  GQueue with no
	    priority sorting whatsoever. At a later point in time we want to implement
	    queue_sorter in a more meaningful way. For example meaning that batch_commits
	    have precedence on all others, that queries get precedence after the batch
	    commits, etcetera.

	    Due to its use of the GMainLoop the API is going to block the mainloop, but it
	    wont block the caller's code. It will instead find a nice slot during the
	    GMainLoop the execute itself on. When finished it'll execute first your
	    callback and then your GDestroyNotify. All parameters that you receive in the
	    callback that aren't user_data must not be freed (they are to be considered
	    read-only in your callback).

	Revert "Added some extra checks for size in mp3 extraction."
	This reverts commit b6a9079cf7ada74e739dbef476df688fda49d88b.

2009-05-07  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

2009-05-06  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Removed **** from low disk space messages in log

	Fixed disk_space_check_stop() critical warning on shutdown

	Fix Valgrind errors / leaks and added public API parameter checks
	This patch removes a lot of casts which were unnecessary. It also
	fixes a memory leak and doesn't allocate memory unnecessarily in
	places. There were also reports from Valgrind about use of uninitiated
	memory which should be fixed now. Public APIs now have full variable
	checking on to throw out any erroneous calls.

	Fixed indexer invalid writes in state_to_string() if string is empty
	We assumed the string was always > 3 characters long and we always
	truncated the last 3 characters which had the separator " | " appened.

	Fixes: NB#114354, trackerd polls
	This was more work than I expected. I think I fixed another bug with
	the testing on this one. We now make sure that if we go back to IDLE
	state after we have finished PENDING/WATCHING states for crawling we
	correct the state to go straight back to PAUSED if we are paused for
	any of the reasons we can be paused. The bug here was that we ended up
	indexing content if we paused based on a full disk if the full disk
	state occurred BEFORE we finished crawling the file system.

	Also, we now watch the TrackerConfig low-disk-space-limit notify
	signal to update in real time.

2009-05-06  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Ensure a transaction is started right after getting metadata/text.

2009-05-05  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	plugins: Do not perform too many statements per transaction

	plugins: Remove the indexer part of the push modules
	After the reachitecture the indexer wont do the writes, the daemon wil.
	This means that we must not proxy the request to the indexer anymore,
	instead will the daemon perform the write immediately itself.

	Applied several ontology fixes to the KMail and Evolution push modules

2009-05-05  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	user annotations.

	rasqal: Support DROP GRAPH queries

	tracker-indexer: Simplify handling of plain text content

	tracker-indexer: Experimental move to SPARQL

2009-05-04  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixed potential leak found in 0.6 branch last week

	Fixes: GB#572237, Remove deprecated Glib symbols
	This reworks the find_orig_uri() which was broken. This now uses
	g_utf8_casefold() instead of g_utf8_up(). The function now oly uses
	g_utf8_casefold() as a last resort after checking the extensions and
	file "name" parts found in the directory do not match. This should be
	more efficient since string creation only occurs as a last step. Also
	the info and orig_info were not being compared in the first place
	which is another bug fixed here.

2009-04-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Added more information about module use to tracker-extract
	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-extract.c: Added debugging so we know
	  which modules are loaded on start up and to know which modules are
	  used to extract content on a per file basis to help when we have
	  multiple extractors handling the same mime types.

	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-main.c: Change logging format when
	  running stand alone and not writing to a log file and don't log
	  everything, only log based on the verbosity setting.

	Performance improvements to jpeg extraction
	We now do much less unnecessary formatting using libexif for better
	performance.

	Read mp3 files in parts in extraction
	We now read last 128 bytes for id3v1 metadata separately from mmap of the mp3
	file in mp3 extraction for better performance. We now handle large mp3 files
	without problems.

	Fixes NB#111560

2009-04-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Fixes #578159 – Tracker starts to index when removable media is inserted, regardless of user preferences.
	* src/trackerd/tracker-processor.c (tracker_processor_stop): Set state to IDLE
	  right before sending files over to the indexer, so it isn't left in PENDING
	  state if there isn't actually any files in the queues.

2009-04-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Changed stats cache timeout to 5m and signal stat diffs then too

	Fixes: NB#109891, If deleting last music track or last video...
	The cache expires now after 3 minutes instead of 1 minute which was

	items for a service type doesn't show up in the
	SERVICE_STATISTICS_UPDATED signal.

2009-04-24  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Adding missing changes to the makefile for the mockup

2009-04-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Do not make tracker-indexer commit suicide if tracker-extract doesn't get along.
	If tracker-extract fails to return the PID. extractor_pid is 0, so if
	tracker-indexer tries to kill it afterwards, it ends up killing itself.

	Set GError to NULL before passing it to functions.

2009-04-20  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Transient properties
	Added support for transient properties. Right now the support for these
	properties still stores physically. This is done that way because if we'd use
	TEMPORARY tables in sqlite, the table wouldn't be shared between the processes
	of trackerd and tracker-indexer. When we refactor to letting trackerd do both
	writes and reads, we can instead start using TEMPORARY tables. I have added
	the code for this, but commented out in this commit.
