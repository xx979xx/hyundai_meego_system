libgdata
========

libgdata is a GLib-based library for accessing online service APIs using the
GData protocol --- most notably, Google's services. It provides APIs to access
the common Google services, and has full asynchronous support.

See the test programs in gdata/tests/ for simple examples of how to use the
code.

libgdata's API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.

Dependencies
============

* glib-2.0 >= 2.19.0
* libxml-2.0
* gio-2.0 >= 2.17.3
* libsoup-2.4 >= 2.26.1

If compiling with --enable-gnome (for GNOME support):
* libsoup-gnome-2.4

Environment variables
=====================

If the environment variable LIBGDATA_FORCE_HTTP is defined, libgdata will
force the use of HTTP for requests which would otherwise normally use
HTTPS. This allows the network traffic to be debugged more easily.

Licensing
=========

libgdata is licensed under the LGPL; see COPYING.LIB for more details.
