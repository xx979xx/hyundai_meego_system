This package contains the URI.pm module with friends.  The module
implements the URI class.  Objects of this class represent Uniform
Resource Identifier references as specified in RFC 2396 and updated by
RFC 2732.

URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
combine URIs in various ways.

Some tests require an Internet connection to work and are skipped if
one is not active.

You need perl-5.6.1 or better to install this package.  You should also
have the MIME::Base64 module installed.  Installation is otherwise as
usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the
comp.lang.perl.modules USENET Newsgroup.  Bug reports and suggestions
for improvements can be sent to the <libwww@perl.org> mailing list.
