This archive contains bindings for the GLib, GObject and GIO,
to be used in Python. It is a fairly complete set of bindings,
it's already rather useful, and is usable to write moderately
complex programs.  (see the examples directory for some examples
of the simpler programs you could write).

If you have any enhancements or bug reports, please file them in
bugzilla at:
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=pygobject

If you have a patch, file the bug first and then use the "create new
attachment" link on the bug's info page.  My preferred format for
patches is unified diff format (ie. diff -u).  Please don't send me
diffs which don't have any context, as these make it very difficult to
see what the patch does.

New Versions
============

New versions of this package can be found at:
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pygobject/


Mailing list
============

pygobject share mailing list with pygtk. You can subscribe to it through
the web interface:

Requirements
============
  * C compiler (GCC and MSVC supported)
  * Python 2.3.5 or higher
  * Glib 2.22.4 or higher
  * GIO 2.22.4 or higher
  * GIO-unix 2.22.4 or higher
  * libffi (optional)

Copyright Information
=====================

This software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public Licence
(version 2.1, or if you choose, a later version).  Basically just don't
say you wrote bits you didn't.

Compilation
===========

PyGObject uses the standard autotools for the build infrastructure.  To
build, it should be as simple as running:

    $ ./configure --prefix=<prefix where python is installed>
    $ make
    $ make install

If your Python interpreter isn't in the path, or is not called
"python", you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the full path
of the interpreter:

    $ PYTHON=/prefix/bin/python
    $ export PYTHON

If configure can't find GTK+, you may need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable to help it find the libraries.

The "make install" target will generate normal and optimised bytecode
for all the .py files.

Note. If you're installing to another prefix than the one where python
is installed you'll need to set the PYTHONPATH variable to the
$prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages directory created by
the PyGObject installation.

Tests
=====

After having compiled and installed pygobject, you may want to test them.
There are a number of example programs available in the examples/
subdirectory.


Getting Help
============

If you have questions about programming with PyGObject, you might want to
send a message to the mailing list (information on subscribing is
above).  Alternatively, your question may be answered in the PyGTK FAQ:
