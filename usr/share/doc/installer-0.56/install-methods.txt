1)Description of Anaconda Install Methods (and ways of updating it)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
------------

 - "fully exploded tree" - this is a tree which in the root has every
   directory with .rpm files from every CD image merged into one directory
   with the same name.
   (So everything from cd's Client directories goes to Client directory and
   likewise for Server, VT, Workstation ... dirs)

 - "ISO" - the ISO image for a CD image.

 - "anaconda updates" - patches for anaconda to fix bugs/etc.

 - "anaconda updates=[http://url|ftp://url]" - patches for anaconda to fix
   bugs/etc. that can be downloaded from the specified remote location.
   The image is the same format as an updates.img as specified below.

 - all paths without a leading '/' are relative to directory specified
   to installer containing install source.

 - 'updates.img' is a ext2 filesystem containing the updated python
   sources and modules for anaconda.
          
Current Installation Methods:
-----------------------------

- CDROM / DVD
-------------

  Summary:
      This is pretty self-explanatory.  Mounts the disc and installs packages,
      prompts user to switch discs when the next disc is required.

  Update Options: 
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory of disc #1 image.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.

- NFS (from a fully exploded tree)
----------------------------------

  Summary:
      Mounts directory from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.

- NFS (from a directory of ISOs)
--------------------------------

  Summary:
      Loopback mounts ISO images from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.

- FTP/HTTP (from a fully exploded tree)
---------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP or HTTP.

  Update Options:
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.

- FTP/HTTP (from a directory of loopback-mounted ISOs)
------------------------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP or HTTP.  Looks in 'disc1/' directory
      to contain files from disc #1, 'disc2/' for disc #2, etc.  These can be
      created on the server by loopback mounting the ISO images into these
      directories under the directory made available to ftp.

  Update Options:
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory in ISO image for disc #1.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.

Hard Drive from ISOs
--------------------

  Summary:
      Similar to NFS ISO-based method - loopback mounts ISOs in directory
      specified by user.  The ISOs must be on an ext2 or vfat partition,
      not a logical volume.

  Update Options:
      - floppy or USB key drive.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'images/' directory of ISO image for CD #1.
      - remote updates.img downloaded via FTP or HTTP.
  

2)Extra Notes:
--------------

   By default NFS, harddrive, and CDROM/DVD-based installs are graphical,
unless the 'text' option is passed on the boot command line.

   FTP and HTTP are text-based, unless 'graphical' is passed on the command
line.  For a graphical FTP or HTTP install to occur, one of the following
must be true:

   - the file 'RedHat/base/stage2.img' must exist on the install server. In
     this case this file is downloaded int RAM, taking about 64MB to store.
     It is recommended to only use this option on machines with more than
     192MB of RAM.

 or:
 
   - the rescue CD is in the CD drive, in which case the stage2.img file
     will be mounted from the rescue CD.  The packages will still be 
     downloaded from the FTP/HTTP server.  No additional memory is required
     because the second stage of the installer is mounted from the CD.

   You can also specify 'graphical' or 'text' as kickstart directives in
the kickstart config file you use, and this has the same affect as if you
put the directive on the boot command line.
