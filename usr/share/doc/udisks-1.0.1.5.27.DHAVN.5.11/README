OVERVIEW
========

The udisks project provides

 o  A storage daemon that implements well-defined D-Bus interfaces
    that can be used to query and manipulate storage devices.

 o  a command-line tool, udisks(1), that can be used to query and
    use the daemon

VERSIONING and ABI STABILITY
============================

The udisks version number consists of three numbers separated by a .

 o  Major number indicating the feature version

 o  Minor number indicating the ABI for the current feature version

 o  Sub number indicating ABI additions

The ABI is guaranteed to be stable only when the major and minor
number does not change. For example, an application expecting version
1.0.12 will work with any 1.0.x release (such as 1.0.99) as long as
e.g. x >= 12.

The udisks version number can be obtained at compile time using
pkg-config(1):

 $ pkg-config --modversion udisks
 1.0.0

or any of the autoconf macros.

At run-time, the udisks version number can be obtained by querying the
DaemonVersion property (of type 's') on the org.freedesktop.UDisks
interface on the object /org/freedesktop/UDisks owned by the
well-known name org.freedesktop.UDisks on the D-Bus system message
bus. This property is guaranteed to always exist and contain the
version number no matter what the ABI version is:

 $ dbus-send --system                             \
             --print-reply                        \
             --dest=org.freedesktop.UDisks        \
             /org/freedesktop/UDisks              \
             org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get  \
             string:org.freedesktop.UDisks        \
             string:DaemonVersion
  method return sender=:1.172 -> dest=:1.186 reply_serial=2
     variant       string "1.0.0"
