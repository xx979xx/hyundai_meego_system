# pic2graph -- compile PIC image descriptions to bitmap images
#
# by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>, July 2002

# In Unixland, the magic is in knowing what to string together...
#
# Take a pic/eqn diagram on stdin, emit cropped bitmap on stdout.
# The pic markup should *not* be wrapped in .PS/.PE, this script will do that.
# An -unsafe option on the command line enables gpic/groff "unsafe" mode.
# A -format FOO option changes the image output format to any format
# supported by convert(1).  An -eqn option changes the eqn delimiters.
# All other options are passed to convert(1).  The default format in PNG.
#
# Requires the groff suite and the ImageMagick tools.  Both are open source.
# This code is released to the public domain.
#
# Here are the assumptions behind the option processing:
#
# 1. Only the -U option of gpic(1) is relevant.  -C doesn't matter because
#    we're generating our own .PS/.PE, -[ntcz] are irrelevant because we're
#    generating Postscript.
#
# 2. Ditto for groff(1), though it's a longer and more tedious demonstration.
#
# 3. Many options of convert(1) are potentially relevant (especially 
#    -density, -interlace, -transparency, -border, and -comment).
#
# Thus, we pass -U to gpic and groff, and everything else to convert(1).
#
# We don't have complete option coverage on eqn because this is primarily
# intended as a pic translator; we can live with eqn defaults.

# Here goes:
# 1. Wrap the input in dummy .PS/PE macros (and add possibly null .EQ/.EN)
# 2. Process through eqn and pic to emit troff markup.
# 3. Process through groff to emit Postscript.
# 4. Use convert(1) to crop the PostScript and turn it into a bitmap.
