You can get the latest source code by Subversion at InriaGforge:

  svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/trunk mpfr

or

  svn checkout https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/trunk mpfr

(the last argument can be any directory name). You can use

  svn ls svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/branches
  svn ls svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/mpfr/tags

to get the list of branches or tags (releases), then checkout a
particular branch or tag instead of the trunk. Alternatively, you
can now use the "https:" scheme (a.k.a. DAV) instead of "svn:".
For more information about Subversion, please see:

  * http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ (the official Subversion book);
  * http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SvnHelp (written for GCC developers,
    but interesting general information can be found there);
  * http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html (the Subversion FAQ).

Subversion users should read the file "README.dev".

Note: the old CVS repository at cvs-sop.inria.fr is now closed.
