<para>The "ccmake" executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project configuration settings may be specified interactively through this GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal when the program is running.</para>
<para>CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.</para>

    <para>When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's cmake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache-format file.</para>

    <para>There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.
</para><literallayout>  add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]

                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])
</literallayout>
    <para>This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s).  A target created in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.  If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form:
</para><literallayout>  OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
          COMMAND
</literallayout>
    <para>If more than one command is specified they will be executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for backward compatibility and will be ignored.
</para><para>The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a library or executable. This is useful for performing an operation before or after building the target. The command becomes part of the target and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the target is already built, the command will not execute.
</para><literallayout>  add_custom_command(TARGET target
                     PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])
</literallayout>
    <para>This defines a new command that will be associated with building the specified target. When the command will happen is determined by which of the following is specified:
</para><literallayout>  PRE_BUILD - run before all other dependencies
  PRE_LINK - run after other dependencies
  POST_BUILD - run after the target has been built
</literallayout>
    <para>Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio 7 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.
</para><para>If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in the directory given. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the custom command for the first output specified. There must have already been a previous call to this command with the same output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be used in the future.
</para><para>If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.
</para><para>If the output of the custom command is not actually created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.
</para><para>The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.  The language given specifies the programming language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used.  Currently only C and CXX language scanners are supported. Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time.  Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.
</para><para>If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by ADD_EXECUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time.  Additionally a target-level dependency will be added so that the executable target will be built before any target using this custom command.  However this does NOT add a file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to re-run whenever the executable is recompiled.
</para><para>Arguments to COMMAND may use "generator expressions" with the syntax "$&lt;...&gt;".  Generator expressions are evaluted during build system generation to produce information specific to each build configuration.  Valid expressions are:
</para><literallayout>  $&lt;CONFIGURATION&gt;          = configuration name
  $&lt;TARGET_FILE:tgt&gt;        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
  $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt&gt; = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
  $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with soname (.so.3)
</literallayout>
    <para>where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and file name components:
</para><literallayout>  $&lt;TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
  $&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
  $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt&gt;/$&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt&gt;
</literallayout>
    <para>References to target names in generator expressions imply target-level dependencies, but NOT file-level dependencies.  List target names with the DEPENDS option to add file dependencies.
</para><para>The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command depends.  If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake automatically brings the other custom command into the target in which this command is built.  If DEPENDS is not specified the command will run whenever the OUTPUT is missing; if the command does not actually create the OUTPUT then the rule will always run.  If DEPENDS specifies any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target-level dependency is created to make sure the target is built before any target using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an executable or library a file-level dependency is created to cause the custom command to re-run whenever the target is recompiled.

    <para>Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands. The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target. Use ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By default nothing depends on the custom target. Use ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument may reference files and outputs of custom commands created with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file).

When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool-specific special characters.

    <para>Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in the current directory and below.  This command can be used to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add preprocessor definitions.  Flags beginning in -D or /D that look like preprocessor definitions are automatically added to the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trival values may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of backwards compatibility.

    <para>Make a top-level target depend on other top-level targets.  A top-level target is one created by ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET.  Adding dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one target is built before another target.  Dependencies added to an IMPORTED target are followed transitively in its place since the target itself does not build.

                   [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
</literallayout>
    <para>Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not specified, the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues beyond this command.
</para><para>If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL target of the parent directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.  Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This is meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.  Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project() command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).  Note that inter-target dependencies supercede this exclusion.  If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy the dependency.</para>

    <para>If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command adds a test target to the current directory. If ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing.  The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing Exename with the specified arguments.

  $&lt;TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt&gt; = file with soname (.so.3)
</literallayout>
    <para>where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and file name components:

</para><para>It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.</para>

    <para>As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form "CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;" where "&lt;NNNN&gt;" is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.
</para><para>The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.
</para><literallayout>  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch[.tweak]])
</literallayout>
    <para>Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced after the specified version will be unset (unless variable CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; sets a default).  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.
</para><literallayout>  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; NEW)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; OLD)
</literallayout>
    <para>Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.
</para><literallayout>  cmake_policy(GET CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; &lt;variable&gt;)
</literallayout>
    <para>Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.
</para><para>CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:
</para><literallayout>  cmake_policy(PUSH)
  cmake_policy(POP)
</literallayout>
    <para>Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
</para><para>Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack entry.</para>

If &lt;input&gt; is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory.  The &lt;input&gt; must be a file, not a directory.  If &lt;output&gt; is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current binary directory.

</para><para>This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.

If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be ignored.  This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates to TRUE or FALSE in CMake</para>

This is useful during cross-compiling to build utility executables that can run on the host platform in one project and then import them into another project being compiled for the target platform.  If the NAMESPACE option is given the &lt;namespace&gt; string will be prepended to all target names written to the file.  If the APPEND option is given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.

This helps dependent projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree without help from the user.  Note that the entry in the package registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a package configuration file (&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake) that works with the build tree.</para>

    <para>WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'. It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it does not exist.
</para><para>APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will append it to the end of the file
</para><para>READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable. It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.
</para><para>STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.
</para><para>LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating them.
</para><para>REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be returned. Typical usage 
</para><literallayout>  file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)
</literallayout>
    <para>stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line from the input file.
</para><para>GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a relative path to the given path.  (We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to ask CMake to regenerate.)
</para><para>Examples of globbing expressions include:
</para><literallayout>   *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
   *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
   f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt
</literallayout>
    <para>GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake --help-policy CMP0009 for more information.
</para><para>Examples of recursive globbing include:
</para><literallayout>   /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

</para><para>REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also non-empty directories
</para><para>RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given file.
</para><para>TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.  The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".  Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes  one argument.
</para><para>TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from  a cmake style path into the native path style \ for windows and / for UNIX.
</para><para>DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer. If EXPECTED_MD5 sum is specified, the operation will verify that the downloaded file's actual md5 sum matches the expected value. If it does not match, the operation fails with an error. If SHOW_PROGRESS is specified, progress information will be printed as status messages until the operation is complete.
</para><para>The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:
</para><literallayout>  file(&lt;COPY|INSTALL&gt; files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
       [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
       [FILES_MATCHING]
       [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
</literallayout>
    <para>The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination is evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.  
</para><para>The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts generated by the install() command use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).</para>

    <para>This command is used to find a full path to named file. A cache entry named by &lt;VAR&gt; is created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be &lt;VAR&gt;-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.

When the package is found package-specific information is provided through variables documented by the package itself.  The QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.  A package-specific list of components may be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS option if no REQUIRED option is given.  The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no [version] is given to a recursive invocation inside a find-module, the [version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call.  Version support is currently provided only on a package-by-package basis (details below).

Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command are encouraged to read on.
</para><para>The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module" mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file called "Find&lt;package&gt;.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no module is found the command proceeds to Config mode.

</literallayout>
    <para>The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly.  It is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced signature.  
</para><para>Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found.  A cache entry called &lt;package&gt;_DIR is created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command searches for a package with the name &lt;package&gt;.  If the NAMES option is given the names following it are used instead of &lt;package&gt;.  The command searches for a file called "&lt;name&gt;Config.cmake" or "&lt;lower-case-name&gt;-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.  Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.  Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file is stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONFIG.
</para><para>All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate version are stored in the cmake variable &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS, the associated versions in &lt;package&gt;_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS. 
</para><para>If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If &lt;package&gt;_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.
</para><para>When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If the EXACT option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file "&lt;config-file&gt;.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next to it and named either "&lt;config-file&gt;-version.cmake" or "&lt;config-file&gt;Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:
</para><literallayout>  PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the &lt;package&gt; name
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string

  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
</literallayout>
    <para>The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:
</para><literallayout>  PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
  PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
  PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible

    <para>The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories.

It is especially useful when cross-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used.

</para><para>The if command was written very early in CMake's history, predating the ${} variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evaluates variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signatures.

</para><literallayout>  set(var1 OFF)

    <para>appears to the if command as
</para><literallayout>  if(var1)

</para><para>There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define installation properties for files and targets.  Properties common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for signatures that specify them.
</para><para>DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
</para><para>PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.  Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.
</para><para>The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build configurations for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).
</para><para>The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation component name with which the install rule is associated, such as "runtime" or "development".  During component-specific installation only install rules associated with the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation all components are installed.
</para><para>The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed file that may be different from the original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is installed by the command.
</para><para>The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error if the file to be installed does not exist.  
</para><para>The TARGETS signature:
</para><literallayout>  install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt;]
          [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
            PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
           [DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;]
           [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
           [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
           [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
           [OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
          ] [...])
</literallayout>
    <para>The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets from a project.  There are five kinds of target files that may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and BUNDLE.  Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as FRAMEWORK targets on OS X.  For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE target. All Windows-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent properties apply.  If none is given the installation properties apply to all target types.  If only one is given then only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install just a DLL or just an import library).
</para><para>The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target's associated files on non-Apple platforms.  Rules defined by these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder.  See documentation of the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for details.
</para><para>Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified as a LIBRARY option.  On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such as
</para><literallayout>  lib&lt;name&gt;.so -&gt; lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1
</literallayout>
    <para>where "lib&lt;name&gt;.so.1" is the soname of the library and "lib&lt;name&gt;.so" is a "namelink" allowing linkers to find the library when given "-l&lt;name&gt;".  The NAMELINK_ONLY option causes installation of only the namelink when a library target is installed.  The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target is installed.  When neither option is given both portions are installed.  On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing.  See the VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on creating versioned shared libraries.
</para><para>One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to the TARGETS form of this command.  A target may be installed more than once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets "myExe", "mySharedLib", and "myStaticLib".  The code
</para><literallayout>    install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
            RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
            LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
            ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
    install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)
</literallayout>
    <para>will install myExe to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and myStaticLib to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static.  On non-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.  On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/bin and /some/full/path and its import library will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/static and /some/full/path. On non-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to &lt;prefix&gt;/lib and /some/full/path.
</para><para>The EXPORT option associates the installed target files with an export called &lt;export-name&gt;.  It must appear before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options.  To actually install the export file itself, call install(EXPORT).  See documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for details.
</para><para>Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.
</para><para>The FILES signature:
</para><literallayout>  install(FILES files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
          [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])
</literallayout>
    <para>The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for a project.  File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default given permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argument is given.
</para><para>The PROGRAMS signature:
</para><literallayout>  install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;]
          [RENAME &lt;name&gt;] [OPTIONAL])
</literallayout>
    <para>The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except that the default permissions for the installed file also include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.  This form is intended to install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the TARGETS form to install targets built within the project.
</para><para>The DIRECTORY signature:
</para><literallayout>  install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;] [FILES_MATCHING]
          [[PATTERN &lt;pattern&gt; | REGEX &lt;regex&gt;]
           [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
</literallayout>
    <para>The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more directories to a given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  If no input directory names are given the destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed into it.  The FILE_PERMISSIONS and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.  If USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is not, file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.  If no permissions are specified files will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES form of the command, and the directories will be given the default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the command.
</para><para>Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity using the PATTERN or REGEX options.  These "match" options specify a globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A PATTERN will match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash.  A REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use '/' and '$' to simulate the PATTERN behavior.  By default all files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.  The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the first match option to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by any expression.  For example, the code
</para><literallayout>  install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
          FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")
</literallayout>
    <para>will extract and install header files from a source tree.
</para><para>Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression and are applied only to files or directories matching them.  The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.  The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For example the code
</para><literallayout>  install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
          PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
          PATTERN "scripts/*"
          PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                      GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)
</literallayout>
    <para>will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons and the scripts directory to share/myproj.  The icons will get default file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any CVS directories will be excluded.
</para><para>The SCRIPT and CODE signature:
</para><literallayout>  install([[SCRIPT &lt;file&gt;] [CODE &lt;code&gt;]] [...])
</literallayout>
    <para>The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files during installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The CODE form will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is specified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string. For example, the code
</para><literallayout>  install(CODE "MESSAGE(\"Sample install message.\")")
</literallayout>
    <para>will print a message during installation.
</para><para>The EXPORT signature:
</para><literallayout>  install(EXPORT &lt;export-name&gt; DESTINATION &lt;dir&gt;
          [NAMESPACE &lt;namespace&gt;] [FILE &lt;name&gt;.cmake]
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT &lt;component&gt;])
</literallayout>
    <para>The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to import targets from the installation tree into another project.  Target installations are associated with the export &lt;export-name&gt; using the EXPORT option of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above.  The NAMESPACE option will prepend &lt;namespace&gt; to the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default the generated file will be called &lt;export-name&gt;.cmake but the FILE option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to the FILE option must be a file name with the ".cmake" extension.  If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only be installed when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the generated import file will reference only the matching target configurations.  If a COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given to the targets associated with &lt;export-name&gt; the behavior is undefined.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.
</para><para>The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use targets built and installed by the current project.  For example, the code

</para><para>When specifying index values, if &lt;element index&gt; is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list element. If &lt;element index&gt; is -1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0. -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

    <para>Define a macro named &lt;name&gt; that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument past the last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake variables you should look at the function command.

    <para>Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it later with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.
</para><para>Properties that affect the name of a target's output file are as follows.  The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override the default target name prefix (such as "lib") and suffix (such as ".so"). IMPORT_PREFIX and IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).  OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built and can be used to help create two targets of the same name even though CMake requires unique logical target names.  There is also a &lt;CONFIG&gt;_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output name on a per-configuration basis.  &lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of the target when it is built under the configuration named by &lt;CONFIG&gt; (in upper-case, such as "DEBUG_POSTFIX").  The value of this property is initialized when the target is created to the value of the variable CMAKE_&lt;CONFIG&gt;_POSTFIX (except for executable targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use this variable for executables).
</para><para>The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt; will add to the configuration &lt;CONFIG&gt;, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  It may also be used to pass additional preprocessor definitions.
</para><para>The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link an executable or shared library. The default is set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and C are common values for this property.
</para><para>For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. 
</para><para>There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules. INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation.  INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. When the target is created the values of the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these properties.
</para><para>PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual studio.  VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.
</para><para>VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER can be set to add support for source control bindings in a  Visual Studio project file.
</para><para>The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.
</para><para>The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual studio generators.  If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of the default build when you select "Build Solution".</para>

    <para id="command_target_link_libraries"><sect2><title>target_link_libraries</title></sect2> Link a target to given libraries.</para>

    <literallayout>  target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; [item1 [item2 [...]]]
                        [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;item&gt;] ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given target.  The named &lt;target&gt; must have been created in the current directory by a command such as add_executable or add_library.  The remaining arguments specify library names or flags.
</para><para>If a library name matches that of another target in the project a dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up-to-date before the target links.  Item names starting with '-', but not '-l' or '-framework', are treated as linker flags.
</para><para>A "debug", "optimized", or "general" keyword indicates that the library immediately following it is to be used only for the corresponding build configuration.  The "debug" keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  The "optimized" keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The "general" keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).  Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.  See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more information.  
</para><para>Library dependencies are transitive by default.  When this target is linked into another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target too.  See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override the set of transitive link dependencies for a target.
</para><literallayout>  target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
                        [[debug|optimized|general] &lt;lib&gt;] ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per-configuration equivalent target properties instead of using them for linking.  Libraries specified as "debug" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  Libraries specified as "optimized" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.  Libraries specified as "general" (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both "debug" and "optimized".
</para><para>The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case of mutually-dependent STATIC libraries CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links to one of the libraries CMake repeats the entire connected component.  For example, the code
</para><literallayout>  add_library(A STATIC a.c)
  add_library(B STATIC b.c)
  target_link_libraries(A B)
  target_link_libraries(B A)
  add_executable(main main.c)
  target_link_libraries(main A)
</literallayout>
    <para>links 'main' to 'A B A B'.  (While one repetition is usually sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require more.  One may handle such cases by manually repeating the component in the last target_link_libraries call.  However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably be combined into a single archive.)</para>
    <para id="command_try_compile"><sect2><title>try_compile</title></sect2> Try building some code.</para>

              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;])
</literallayout>
    <para>Try building a project.  In this form, srcdir should contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted after this command is run. Specify targetName to build a specific target instead of the 'all' or 'ALL_BUILD' target.
</para><literallayout>  try_compile(RESULT_VAR &lt;bindir&gt; &lt;srcfile&gt;

              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
              [COPY_FILE &lt;fileName&gt;])
</literallayout>
    <para>Try building a source file into an executable.  In this form the user need only supply a source file that defines a 'main'.  CMake will create a CMakeLists.txt file to build the source as an executable.  Specify COPY_FILE to get a copy of the linked executable at the given fileName.
</para><para>In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp, will be cleaned automatically, for debugging a --debug-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid the clean. Some extra flags that  can be included are,  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are -Ddefinition that will be passed to the compile line.  try_compile creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that looks like this:
</para><literallayout>  add_definitions( &lt;expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from calling cmake&gt;)
  include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
  link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
  add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
  target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})
</literallayout>
    <para>In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then the output from the build process is stored in the given variable. Return the success or failure in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass -DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the build. Set variable CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION to choose a build configuration.</para>
    <para id="command_try_run"><sect2><title>try_run</title></sect2> Try compiling and then running some code.</para>

</literallayout>
    <para>Try compiling a srcfile.  Return TRUE or FALSE for success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR.  Then if the compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the compile step goes. RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the running executable goes.
</para><para>For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still supported, which gives you the output from the compile and run step combined.
</para><para>Cross compiling issues
</para><para>When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step usually cannot be run on the build host. try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If that's the case, it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not try to run the executable. Instead it will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable would have produced if it would have been run on its actual target platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (explanation see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.
</para><para>In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling, the cache variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable. You can also "guard" the calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.

    <para id="command_build_name"><sect2><title>build_name</title></sect2> Deprecated.  Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.</para>

    <literallayout>  build_name(variable)
</literallayout>
    <para>Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and compiler settings.  These values are now available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.</para>
    <para id="command_exec_program"><sect2><title>exec_program</title></sect2> Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.</para>

    <para>Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt file.
</para><literallayout>  exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
               [ARGS &lt;arguments to executable&gt;]
               [OUTPUT_VARIABLE &lt;var&gt;]
               [RETURN_VALUE &lt;var&gt;])
</literallayout>
    <para>The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to the program.   This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running cmake.
</para>
    <para id="command_export_library_dependencies"><sect2><title>export_library_dependencies</title></sect2> Deprecated.  Use INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.</para>

    <para>This command generates an old-style library dependencies file.  Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command.  Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to help export targets from an installation tree and the export() command to export targets from a build tree.
</para><para>The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account per-configuration names of libraries or the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property.
</para><literallayout>  export_library_dependencies(&lt;file&gt; [APPEND])
</literallayout>
    <para>Create a file named &lt;file&gt; that can be included into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number of SET commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency information.  This should be the last command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file of the project.  If the APPEND option is specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead of replacing it.</para>
    <para id="command_install_files"><sect2><title>install_files</title></sect2> Deprecated.  Use the install(FILES ) command instead.</para>

    <para>This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the install command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.
</para><literallayout>  install_files(&lt;dir&gt; extension file file ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into the given directory.  Only files existing in the current source tree or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a file specified already has an extension, that extension will be removed first.  This is useful for providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is '.h'.
</para><literallayout>  install_files(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)
</literallayout>
    <para>Any files in the current source directory that match the regular expression will be installed.
</para><literallayout>  install_files(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file file ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be installed explicitly from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.
</para><para>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</para>
    <para id="command_install_programs"><sect2><title>install_programs</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS ) command instead.</para>

    <para>This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the INSTALL command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.
</para><literallayout>  install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; file1 file2 [file3 ...])
  install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; FILES file1 [file2 ...])
</literallayout>
    <para>Create rules to install the listed programs into the given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that the file list version of the command will be used even when there is only one argument.
</para><literallayout>  install_programs(&lt;dir&gt; regexp)
</literallayout>
    <para>In the second form any program in the current source directory that matches the regular expression will be installed.
</para><para>This command is intended to install programs that are not built by cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the TARGETS form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.
</para><para>The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.</para>
    <para id="command_install_targets"><sect2><title>install_targets</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )  command instead.</para>

    <para>This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.
</para><literallayout>  install_targets(&lt;dir&gt; [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)
</literallayout>
    <para>Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory.  The directory &lt;dir&gt; is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified, then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.</para>
    <para id="command_link_libraries"><sect2><title>link_libraries</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the target_link_libraries() command instead.</para>

    <para>Link libraries to all targets added later.
</para><literallayout>  link_libraries(library1 &lt;debug | optimized&gt; library2 ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any following targets (typically added with the add_executable or add_library calls).  This command is passed down to all subdirectories.  The debug and optimized strings may be used to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only for that specific type of build.</para>
    <para id="command_make_directory"><sect2><title>make_directory</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.</para>

    <literallayout>  make_directory(directory)
</literallayout>
    <para>Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any parent directories that do not exist will also be created.  Use with care.</para>
    <para id="command_remove"><sect2><title>remove</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.</para>

    <literallayout>  remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Removes VALUE from the variable VAR.  This is typically used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon separated list).  VALUE is expanded.</para>
    <para id="command_subdir_depends"><sect2><title>subdir_depends</title></sect2> Deprecated.  Does nothing.</para>

    <literallayout>  subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>Does not do anything.  This command used to help projects order parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.</para>
    <para id="command_subdirs"><sect2><title>subdirs</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command instead.</para>

    <para>Add a list of subdirectories to the build.
</para><literallayout>  subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
          [PREORDER] )
</literallayout>
    <para>Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs although subdirs will still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER flag has no effect on IDE projects.  Any directories after the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top level makefile or project file. This is useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top.</para>
    <para id="command_use_mangled_mesa"><sect2><title>use_mangled_mesa</title></sect2> Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.</para>

    <literallayout>  use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)
</literallayout>
    <para>The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.  The mesa headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to the include directory path earlier.</para>
    <para id="command_utility_source"><sect2><title>utility_source</title></sect2> Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.</para>

    <literallayout>  utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                 path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])
</literallayout>
    <para>When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will not be set unless the path_to_source and all listed files exist.  It is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built before it is needed.
</para><para>When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a utility_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an executable which is executed later on. This doesn't work when cross compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.</para>
    <para id="command_variable_requires"><sect2><title>variable_requires</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the if() command instead.</para>

    <para>Assert satisfaction of an option's required variables.
</para><literallayout>  variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)
</literallayout>
    <para>The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set. The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set to NOTFOUND to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is reported.</para>
    <para id="command_write_file"><sect2><title>write_file</title></sect2> Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.</para>

    <literallayout>  write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])
</literallayout>
    <para>The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified, then the message will be appended.
</para><para>NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as this one but add some more functionality.
</para><para>NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you want to generate input files to CMake.</para>
