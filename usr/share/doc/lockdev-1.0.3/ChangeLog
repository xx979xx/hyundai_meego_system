	* LockDev/Makefile.PL: Merge shobs support from the Debian diff.

	* Makefile Merge shobs support from the Debian diff.
	(tarball): Remove --exclude option which was broken with current
	versions of GNU tar.

	* src/sample.c (main): Use liblockdev_incr_debug when the "-d"
	option is used, to fix broken debugging support.

	* src/ttylock.h: Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.

	* src/lockdev.h: Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.

	* src/lockdev.c:
	(General) Replace the use of __linux__ with __GNU_LIBRARY__, and
	use the GNU libc gnu_dev_major() and gnu_dev_minor() functions
	rather than kernel macros.
	(General) Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.
	(_dl_filename_1): Remove special casing for CUA devices on Linux
	systems; these devices have long been deprecated and are no longer
	available in current kernels.
	(_dl_filename_2): If a device name has '/' separators in its name,
	replace them with ':'s.  This is to support devices in
	subdirectories.
	(_dl_check_devname): If a device pathname starts with DEV_PATH,
	e.g. "/dev/", strip off only "/dev/", rather than the entire path.
	This is to support devices in subdirectories under /dev,
	e.g. DevFS, udev, devpts and LVM.
