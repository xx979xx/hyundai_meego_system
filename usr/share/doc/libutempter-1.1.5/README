The libutempter library provides interface for terminal emulators such as
screen and xterm to record user sessions to utmp and wtmp files.

The utempter is a privileged helper used by libutempter library to manipulate
utmp and wtmp files.

This implementation is based on ideas of RedHat's utempter by Erik Troan
(version 0.5.2 at the moment of writing).

There are two interfaces supported: old and new.
Old API is provided for backwards compatibility with old RedHat's utempter.
New API is recommended for new applications because it is more clean
than old one.
There are no plans to drop or make incompatible changes to these interfaces.
