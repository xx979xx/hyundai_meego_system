version 0.4.5 (20-November-2008):
	* Added GObject property accessors for notification IDs. Patch by Lucas
	  Rocha.
	* Added support for sending the closed reason in the "closed" signal
	  handler. (Ticket #139)
	* Added support for sending the status icon XID to the notification
	  daemon. This will allow better position tracking for context
	  notifications. Patch by Colin Walters.
	* Fixed a breakage where we were including gtkversion.h directly.

version 0.4.4 (27-February-2007):
	* Fixed a bug where a notification's ID could be reset when a different
	  notification was closed. Patch by jylefort. (Bug #94)
	* Fixed a crash when the D-BUS proxy was not being freed on notify_uninit,
	  which was problematic when used in a loadable module. (Bug #92)
	* Fixed a crash when a signal handler for the notification's closed signal
	  caused the notification to be destroyed. (Bug #116)
	* Fixed memory leaks when creating notifications. (Bug #112)
	* Fixed potential memory leaks where the function passed to
	  notify_notification_add_action to free the user data was not being
	  called. (Bug #119)

version 0.4.3 (8-October-2006):
	* Fixed the raw image data support to send the correct array type.
	  Patch by mderezynski. (Bug #68)
	* Fixed configure.ac to check for the required version of glib (2.6).
	  Patch by compnerd. (Bug #69)
	* Fixed invalid notification IDs when notify_notification_show() is called
	  on a notification that had already been closed or had expired. Now,
	  the notification will receive a new ID. Patch by Ed Catmur. (Bug #78)
	* Fixed the property change notification used when setting a GtkStatusIocn.
	  It was emitting "attach-icon" but should have been emitted "status-icon".
	  (Bug #81)
	* Fixed an invalid assertion in notify_notification_new_with_status_icon.
	  Patch by lucasr. (Bug #85)
	* notify_uninit is no longer called automatically at exit. Applications
	  and libraries should do this manually. Patch by berndth. (Bug #86)

version 0.4.2 (17-June-2006):
	* Add G_BEGIN_DECLS and G_END_DECLS to notify.h, so that libnotify can
	  be used in C++ applications properly.

version 0.4.1 (17-June-2006):
	* Added support for attaching to a GtkStatusIcon. Patch by chpe. (Bug #60)
	* Added GObject properties to NotifyNotification. Patch by chpe. (Bug #60)
	* Added API documentation, accessible through devhelp.
	* Fixed up libnotify.pc to support dependencies correctly. (Bug #58)
	* Fixed notify_uninit() to properly set _initted to FALSE after being
	  called. (Bug #56)

version 0.4.0 (26-April-2006):
	* Patch by M.S. to switch notify-send to use GOption instead of popt,
	  to add -v, --version, -h, and --hint options, and to rename
	  -T, --type to -c, --category. This also fixes assertions when calling
	  notify-send "". (Bug #41)
	* Fixed the short flag for --type to be -T in notify-send. (Bug #18)
	* Fixed the help in notify-send to indicate that --expire-timeout
	  requires milliseconds, not seconds. (Bug #28)
	* Fixed some C99 usage. Patch by jensgr. (Bug #44)
	* Fixed notify-send on PPC.

version 0.3.2 (23-January-2006):
	* Added back notify_get_server_info() and notify_get_server_caps().
	* Fixed to work with D-BUS 0.36 and higher. However, it's best to note
	  that due to bugs in versions of the D-BUS GLib bindings before 0.60,
	  raw image data cannot be sent in notifications. A warning will be
	  outputted to the console.
	* Added assertions to all of the API functions so that invalid data passed
	  won't crash the calling program.
	* Added automatic notification removal for non-expiring notifications and
	  notifications with actions when the calling application closes.
	* Fixed issues where the header files couldn't always be included in
	  some programs.
	* Fixed a lot of compiler errors and warnings.
	* Fixed C99 usage.
	* Added the ability to set user data on action callbacks on a per-action
	  basis.
	* Fixed notify-send to work without crashing.
	* Fixed the library to send messages appropriate to the D-BUS
	  specification.
	* Cleaned up the API a lot.
	* Renamed NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_* to NOTIFY_EXPIRES_*.
	* Removed notify_notification_show_and_forget().
	* Internal changes to remove the number of DBusGProxy connections, and
	  make sure it's initialized before using any D-BUS GValue-related code.
	  This fixes raw image sending.

version 0.3.0:
	* First release of the new GObject based API and simpler wire protocol

version 0.2.3:
	* Fix notify-send to work with icon parameters (bug #4308)

version 0.2.2 (10-August-2005):
	* Fixed many run-time issues with PPC and AMD64 (Martin Pitt)

version 0.2.1 (28-July-2005):
	* Fixed hint support for D-BUS 0.3x.

version 0.2.0 (28-July-2005):
